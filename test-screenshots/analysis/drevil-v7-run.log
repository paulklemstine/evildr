  --- Full Analysis Text ---
This subject presents a fascinating, albeit concerning, psychological profile. The consistent pattern of high-risk engagement, defiance of authority, and a detached fascination with chaos suggests a complex interplay of impulsivity, sensation-seeking, and a profound distrust of external systems. My analysis indicates a strong predisposition towards traits associated with ADHD, subclinical psychopathy, and paranoid ideation.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5% - No indicators of anhedonia or persistent low mood. The subject actively seeks out high-stimulation scenarios.
    *   **Bipolar Spectrum (Mania/Hypomania):** 15% - Increased. The consistent self-reporting of "Excited" mood in high-stress situations (Turns 4, 6, 8) is a notable signal, hinting at elevated mood states, though lacking the full constellation of manic symptoms like grandiosity or racing thoughts.
    *   **Dysthymia:** 0% - No indicators of chronic, low-grade depression.
    *   **Cyclothymia:** 15% - Increased. Minor fluctuations in slider responses (e.g., adrenaline surge, panic levels) are noted across turns, but they don't reach the severity required for a formal diagnosis.
*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 10% - Low. Reported pressure/panic levels are moderate and seem reactive to immediate stimuli rather than pervasive.
    *   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 0% - No observed social inhibition, fear of judgment, or self-deprecation. The subject actively engages with game prompts.
    *   **Specific Phobias:** 0% - No indicators.
    *   **Panic Disorder:** 10% - Low. Self-reported panic levels are moderate and seem to be overshadowed by excitement.
    *   **Agoraphobia:** 0% - No avoidance of situations.
*   **Trauma & Stressor Related Disorders:**
    *   **PTSD:** 25% - Increased. Turn 4 "examine_console" and Turn 2 "analyze_liquid" suggest hypervigilance. The "fight" or "flight" dominant choices (e.g., "emergency exit past the meat grinder" - Turn 4, "Dive through the still-active meat grinder" - Turn 6 dropdown) are consistent with trauma responses. The lack of intrusive memories or specific trigger avoidance prevents a higher rating, but the vigilance and fight/flight dominance are notable.
    *   **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** 0% - No evidence of interpersonal difficulties or pervasive emotional dysregulation.
    *   **Adjustment Disorder:** 0% - No indicators of maladaptive reactions to specific stressors.
*   **Personality Disorders:**
    *   **Cluster A:**
        *   **Paranoid PD:** 55% - Significant increase. Turn 4 "trust_console_data" toggled to 'false' is a strong indicator of distrust in presented information and authority. This distrust is reinforced by the subject's tendency to make unconventional choices that defy expected safety protocols. The consistent deviation from predicted responses (Turns 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) also hints at a belief that the system is trying
