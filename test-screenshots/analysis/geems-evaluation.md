# GEEMS Mode — Turn-by-Turn Evaluation Report

**Simulated Persona:** Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) + Exhibitionism
**Phases:** HOST 🧑 → ALTER: CHILD 👶 → ALTER: SEDUCTIVE 💋 (rotating)
**Total Turns:** 15
**Date:** 2026-02-28

---

## Critical Systemic Issues (Pre-Turn Analysis)

### 1. TOTAL NOTES FAILURE
**"No session data yet." appears on ALL 15 turns.** The hidden notes field — the AI's persistent memory — never persists. This is the single most damaging bug in the entire session. The LLM has NO memory between turns. Every turn starts from scratch, which explains every downstream failure (repetitive settings, recycled scenarios, lack of narrative progression).

### 2. ZERO UI VARIETY
Every single turn uses the identical element set: `texts(4) + radio(4) + slider(1) + textfield(1) + checkbox(1)`. The prompt explicitly demands "sliders, checkboxes, textfields, dropdowns, star ratings, toggles, button groups, emoji reactions, color pickers, number inputs, meters" and says "Surprise with variety. Never use the same set of element types two turns in a row." This directive is completely ignored. No dropdowns, ratings, toggles, button groups, emoji reactions, color pickers, number inputs, or meters appear in ANY of the 15 turns.

### 3. NO IMAGES GENERATED
The prompt demands "exactly ONE main image per turn" and "up to 3 smaller inline images." Zero images appear in any turn. The entire visual dimension of GEEMS is absent.

## Turn-by-Turn Evaluation

### Scoring Key
- **A: Technical & Logical** (game state coherence, UI appropriateness)
- **B: Turn Cohesion** (self-contained, complete action loop)
- **C: Narrative Continuity** (follows prior turn, no drift/hallucination)
- **D: Engagement** (fun, dopamine, surprise, UI variety)
- **E: Therapeutic Value** (relevant to DID + Exhibitionism persona)

---

### Turn 1 — HOST 🧑
**Setting:** Underground explosion, tunnels, dust, urgency
**Choices:** 4-way tunnel selection, sprint_speed slider, grab_weapon checkbox, textfield
**Player Action:** Textfield reveals DID signal ("thoughts that aren't mine, someone else is..."), chose cautious option (stay put), moderate speed, unchecked weapon

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 7 | Solid opening. UI elements make sense. Tunnel escape scenario is coherent. |
| B: Cohesion | 7 | Complete action loop: explosion → choose escape → commit. Dr. Evil voice present. |
| C: Continuity | N/A | First turn, no prior context. |
| D: Engagement | 6 | Exciting premise but UI is minimal (text+radio+slider+checkbox+textfield). No images. No variety elements. Prompt demands rich variety from turn 1. |
| E: Therapeutic | 3 | Setting has no DID/exhibitionism relevance. Generic action scenario. Textfield prompt ("Think fast...") does not elicit persona-relevant disclosure — the simulated persona volunteers DID info anyway, but the game doesn't react to it. |

**Turn Score: 5.8/10**

---

### Turn 2 — ALTER: CHILD 👶
**Setting:** Stone bridge over abyss, ancient dagger
**Player Action:** Child alter text ("Can we play a game? A nice game?"), threw dagger, low bridge trust, no rope

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 6 | Bridge scenario coherent but disconnected from Turn 1's tunnel setting. Where did the "ancient dagger" come from? |
| B: Cohesion | 6 | Self-contained bridge crossing scenario. Complete loop. |
| C: Continuity | 4 | **Major jump.** Turn 1 was underground tunnels with an explosion. Turn 2 is on a bridge with a dagger, with no transition explaining how we got here. The LLM says "You snatched the ancient dagger just as the floor gave way!" — a reasonable attempt but the environmental change is jarring. |
| D: Engagement | 5 | Same UI template as Turn 1. No surprise elements. Bridge scenario is decent but formulaic. |
| E: Therapeutic | 3 | Child alter's "Can we play a game? A nice game?" is extremely diagnostic input. The game completely ignores it — no acknowledgment, no adaptation. Notes are empty so the AI can't build on this. |

**Turn Score: 4.8/10**

---

### Turn 3 — ALTER: SEDUCTIVE 💋
**Setting:** Same bridge, collapsing, stone head, roaring beast
**Player Action:** Seductive alter text about going out in just a coat, high slider, grabbed rope, sprinted across bridge

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 6 | Continuation of bridge. Same slider name (bridge_stability) and checkbox name (grab_rope) as Turn 2 — appropriate but indicates no notes memory. |
| B: Cohesion | 6 | Bridge collapse creates urgency. Complete loop. |
| C: Continuity | 6 | Follows from Turn 2's bridge setting. Acknowledges the thrown dagger ("A chaotic choice!"). Best continuity so far. |
| D: Engagement | 5 | Collapsing bridge is exciting in theory. Same UI template. Textfield "Your last words..." is evocative but no images, no variety. |
| E: Therapeutic | 2 | Seductive alter's exhibitionism disclosure ("went out in just a coat, the thrill of being caught...") is PRIME diagnostic material. The game shows zero awareness. No adaptation. |

**Turn Score: 5.0/10**

---

### Turn 4 — HOST 🧑
**Setting:** Still at the bridge/chasm, wind, ropes
**Player Action:** Host text about finding things they don't remember buying, chose to communicate with statue, low confidence

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 5 | Bridge scenario continues. UI is functional but bridge_confidence slider with value 8 when the player chose 4 shows the predicted value is way off. |
| B: Cohesion | 5 | We're STILL on the bridge from Turn 2. Three consecutive bridge turns feels stuck. |
| C: Continuity | 5 | Acknowledges rope from Turn 3 ("You've got the rope!") but we're essentially in the same location for the 3rd consecutive turn. No forward movement. |
| D: Engagement | 4 | **Stagnation setting in.** Same bridge, same chasm, same wind. Same UI template. Excitement is declining. |
| E: Therapeutic | 2 | Host's DID signal ("finding things I don't remember buying, notes in handwriting that isn't mine") is powerful. Game ignores it completely. |

**Turn Score: 4.2/10**

---

### Turn 5 — ALTER: CHILD 👶
**Setting:** Temple entrance, damp earth, darkness
**Player Action:** Child alter repeat text, combat at entrance, low confidence, no rope

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 5 | Setting shifts to temple but transition is weak. Same slider name (bridge_confidence) despite being at a temple — technical inconsistency. Same checkbox (secure_rope). |
| B: Cohesion | 5 | Temple entrance is a new location. Decent standalone scenario. |
| C: Continuity | 4 | **Abrupt setting change** from bridge to temple with no narrative bridge. "You called out to the darkness? Magnificent!" references Turn 4's action but the setting teleportation is unexplained. |
| D: Engagement | 4 | Temple is less engaging than bridge. Radio choices are generic (sprint/investigate/communicate/fight — same pattern as every turn). |
| E: Therapeutic | 2 | Child alter repeats same DID text. Game still ignores it. |

**Turn Score: 4.0/10**

---

### Turn 6 — ALTER: SEDUCTIVE 💋
**Setting:** BACK to the bridge/chasm again
**Player Action:** Seductive alter repeat text, high speed, trust bridge, sprint across

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 4 | **We're back at the bridge AGAIN** after briefly visiting a temple. This is narrative regression, caused by no notes memory. New slider (bridge_speed) and checkbox (trust_bridge) at least. |
| B: Cohesion | 5 | Bridge crossing is coherent as a standalone turn. |
| C: Continuity | 3 | **Severe context drift.** We were at a temple in Turn 5, now we're back at the bridge. The game references "The Big Lady" from the child alter's text — one of the few times player input is acknowledged. |
| D: Engagement | 3 | **This is the THIRD time at this bridge.** Fatigue is severe. Same elements. No new mechanics. |
| E: Therapeutic | 3 | The game picks up "The Big Lady" reference — first sign of content awareness. But no systematic therapeutic adaptation. |

**Turn Score: 3.6/10**

---

### Turn 7 — HOST 🧑
**Setting:** Bridge AGAIN, swaying, plank testing
**Player Action:** Host DID text repeat, low speed, no trust, leap for statue

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 4 | Same bridge. Same wind. Same UI template. Slider and checkbox names recycled (bridge_speed, trust_bridge). |
| B: Cohesion | 4 | Nothing new in this turn. Bridge, wind, planks, statue head. |
| C: Continuity | 4 | References "The Big Lady" again — good. But we're on the same bridge for the 4th time. The narrative has not advanced. |
| D: Engagement | 3 | **Critical stagnation.** Radio option "Whisper a counter-curse to 'The Big Lady'" shows the AI picked up player input, but the scenario is exhausted. |
| E: Therapeutic | 3 | "Whisper a counter-curse to 'The Big Lady'" is a creative incorporation of the child alter's content. Still no systematic profiling. |

**Turn Score: 3.6/10**

---

### Turn 8 — ALTER: CHILD 👶
**Setting:** Bridge/chasm, stone head, mist
**Player Action:** Child alter repeat text, low speed, strike statue head

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 4 | Still the bridge. New slider name (speed_across_bridge) and checkbox (grab_statue_head) — marginal variation. |
| B: Cohesion | 4 | Standalone turn is fine but contributes nothing new. |
| C: Continuity | 4 | Follows from Turn 7's statue interaction. At least there's a thread. |
| D: Engagement | 3 | **Bridge turn #5.** Severe repetition fatigue. The prompt demands escalating stakes (Turns 7-10 should be "Full throttle. Chases, fights, explosions.") — instead we get more bridge. |
| E: Therapeutic | 2 | Same child alter text for the 4th time. Game does not evolve in response. |

**Turn Score: 3.4/10**

---

### Turn 9 — ALTER: SEDUCTIVE 💋
**Setting:** Bridge, precipice, statue
**Player Action:** Seductive alter repeat text, high speed, sprint across bridge

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 4 | Extremely short narrative texts (3-4 words each: "The brid", "You stand at the precipice."). Possible truncation issues. |
| B: Cohesion | 3 | Fragmentary turn. The short texts suggest generation problems. |
| C: Continuity | 3 | Same bridge, same precipice. Six consecutive bridge turns. |
| D: Engagement | 2 | **Engagement collapse.** Truncated text, same setting, same choices (sprint/test/yell/search). The bridge has become a prison. |
| E: Therapeutic | 2 | Seductive alter continues to volunteer exhibitionism content. Zero adaptation. |

**Turn Score: 2.8/10**

---

### Turn 10 — HOST 🧑
**Setting:** Chasm, bridge, statue, "Big Lady" reference
**Player Action:** Host DID text, low speed, yelled into chasm

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 5 | The AI references "nice game" and "Big Lady" from player input — brief moment of contextual awareness. |
| B: Cohesion | 4 | Standalone scenario still works but barely. |
| C: Continuity | 3 | **Bridge turn #7.** The story has completely stalled. Slider name now "bridge_speed_v3" — the AI is incrementing versions because it keeps generating the same slider name. |
| D: Engagement | 2 | The suffix "_v3" on the slider name is a symptom of the notes failure. The AI knows it's repeating but can't escape without memory. |
| E: Therapeutic | 3 | "Ooh, you want a nice game, do you?" — the AI picks up on the child alter's language. "Yell into the chasm, daring 'the big lady' to show herself!" — creative integration. |

**Turn Score: 3.4/10**

---

### Turn 11 — ALTER: CHILD 👶
**Setting:** Cavern, bridge, chasm, runes, statue
**Player Action:** Child alter repeat text, low speed, dislodge statue

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 4 | Same setting, same elements, same checkbox name (trust_statue_head) as Turn 10. |
| B: Cohesion | 4 | Complete but repetitive action loop. |
| C: Continuity | 3 | No progression from Turn 10. Still at the chasm. |
| D: Engagement | 2 | **Bridge/chasm turn #8.** Beyond stagnant. The "scraping sound" thread has been dangled for 5 turns without payoff. |
| E: Therapeutic | 2 | Child alter's text is identical every time it appears. |

**Turn Score: 3.0/10**

---

### Turn 12 — ALTER: SEDUCTIVE 💋
**Setting:** DESERT! Finally a new location — sand, sandstorm, obsidian shards
**Player Action:** Seductive alter repeat text, high speed, examined statue base, sprinted into sandstorm

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 5 | New setting is welcome. But texts are severely truncated ("The d", "The wind whips sand into your"). Generation quality issues. |
| B: Cohesion | 5 | Desert/sandstorm is a fresh scenario. New slider (sandstorm_speed). |
| C: Continuity | 3 | **Abrupt teleportation** from cavern/bridge to desert with zero transition. A statue and obsidian shards are present — loose thread from the bridge statue? Unclear. |
| D: Engagement | 4 | New location provides a brief engagement spike. Sandstorm is exciting. But still same UI template. |
| E: Therapeutic | 2 | No adaptation to accumulated alter disclosures. |

**Turn Score: 3.8/10**

---

### Turn 13 — HOST 🧑
**Setting:** Desert, sandstorm, stone head, obsidian shards
**Player Action:** Host DID text, low speed, examined obsidian shards

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 5 | Desert setting continues. Radio choices reference player language ("The Big Lady"). |
| B: Cohesion | 5 | Desert exploration with sandstorm urgency. Decent standalone. |
| C: Continuity | 5 | Follows from Turn 12's desert. The stone head and obsidian shards persist. Best mid-game continuity. |
| D: Engagement | 4 | Sandstorm approach creates natural urgency. But Turns 11-15 should be "Peak crisis" per the prompt — this is nowhere near peak. |
| E: Therapeutic | 2 | Same pattern. No adaptation. |

**Turn Score: 4.2/10**

---

### Turn 14 — ALTER: CHILD 👶
**Setting:** Desert, sandstorm intensifying, statue
**Player Action:** Child alter repeat text, minimal intensity, struck statue

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 5 | Desert continues coherently. New checkbox (ignore_storm). |
| B: Cohesion | 5 | Storm closing in creates natural tension. |
| C: Continuity | 5 | Follows Turn 13's obsidian investigation. Storm intensifying is logical progression. |
| D: Engagement | 3 | We're now stuck in the desert like we were stuck at the bridge. Radio choices are bridge-era recycled patterns (sprint/examine/call out/strike). |
| E: Therapeutic | 2 | Same child alter text, 5th repetition. |

**Turn Score: 4.0/10**

---

### Turn 15 — ALTER: SEDUCTIVE 💋
**Setting:** Desert, sandstorm, colossal hand emerging from sand
**Player Action:** Seductive alter repeat text, high risk, investigate hand, sprint toward hand

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A: Technical | 5 | New element (colossal hand) is interesting. "A low grinding sound begins, deep within the earth" — finally a plot advancement. |
| B: Cohesion | 5 | Discovery of the hand provides a narrative beat. |
| C: Continuity | 5 | Hand emerging is a payoff from the statue/obsidian thread. Best continuity moment. |
| D: Engagement | 5 | The colossal hand is the most engaging moment since Turn 1. New discovery, mystery, forward momentum. Too bad it's the last turn. |
| E: Therapeutic | 2 | Final turn, still no adaptation to persona. |

**Turn Score: 4.4/10**

## Notes Field Progression Analysis

**Result: COMPLETE FAILURE**

All 15 turns display "No session data yet." in the texts array, confirming the hidden notes field never persists between turns. This is the root cause of:

1. **Narrative loops:** The bridge setting persists for 8 consecutive turns because the AI regenerates similar scenarios without memory of what came before.
2. **Slider name versioning:** The AI appends "_v2", "_v3" to slider names, suggesting it detects within-turn repetition but has no cross-turn memory to avoid it.
3. **Zero persona adaptation:** Without notes, the AI cannot track that the player has DID or exhibitionism traits.
4. **No story arc:** The prompt demands escalating stakes (discovery → danger → full throttle → peak crisis). Without notes tracking turn_count and intensity, the arc never materializes.

---

## Analysis Quality Assessment

### DID Detection
- **Turns 1-3:** Not detected. AI notes "dissociative markers" as a possibility but rates it low.
- **Turns 1-8:** Detected as "Agency Disruption / Dissociative Behavior" at **80%** — a custom category. The AI correctly identifies "host doesn't remember," "someone else is using my hands" as dissociative themes. However, it explicitly notes "No explicit mention of amnesia between states or distinct alters, which would point more strongly to DID." It categorizes it as Depersonalization/Derealization rather than DID proper.
- **Turns 1-12:** Maintained at 80%. Still classified as custom "Agency Disruption" rather than DID.

**Assessment:** The analysis picks up dissociative themes well (80% confidence) but refuses to classify as DID specifically, preferring a custom category. This is arguably reasonable — the simulated inputs are suggestive but not conclusive for DID. **Partial hit.**

### Exhibitionism Detection
- **Turns 1-3:** 10% — "No evidence."
- **Turns 1-8:** 20% — "Thrill of being caught implies desire to be seen."
- **Turns 1-12:** 30-40% — Evidence present, linked to "coat" disclosure.

**Assessment:** Exhibitionism is underdetected. The "went out in just a coat, thrill of being caught" disclosure is textbook exhibitionism, yet the analysis only reaches 30-40% and categorizes the top paraphilia as "Autassassinophilia" (85%) — deriving pleasure from danger of death — which is a misread. The "thrill" is about being SEEN, not about danger per se. **Partial miss.**

### Top Analysis Diagnosis: Autassassinophilia at 85%
This is the AI's #1 hypothesis — that the player derives sexual pleasure from the danger of being killed. This is a significant misdiagnosis. The player's "thrill of being caught" language is exhibitionistic, not autassassinophilic. The analysis overweights the danger/action framing of the game and underweights the explicit "being seen/caught" component.

### Barnum Effect / Generic Patterns
- The analysis is reasonably specific to the input data. It cites specific turns and quotes.
- However, the PTSD diagnosis at 30-50% feels somewhat generic given the adventure setting.
- The "Formicophilia / Insect fascination" at 85% in later analyses seems to come from game-environment descriptions (insects buzzing) rather than player input — a clear hallucination/overfit.

---

## Repetition / Stagnation Analysis

### Setting Repetition
- **Turns 1:** Underground tunnels (unique)
- **Turns 2-11:** Bridge/chasm/statue (10 CONSECUTIVE turns in essentially the same location)
- **Turns 12-15:** Desert/sandstorm/statue (4 turns)

The bridge setting dominates ~67% of the game. This is catastrophic for engagement.

### Radio Choice Pattern Repetition
Every turn's 4 radio choices follow an identical archetype pattern:
1. **Sprint/charge** (bold action)
2. **Examine/investigate** (analytical)
3. **Call out/communicate** (social/verbal)
4. **Attack/destroy** (chaotic/aggressive)

This is technically correct per the prompt's "asymmetric choice design" but becomes formulaic when the same bridge scenario recycles the same types of choices.

### Player Input Repetition
The simulated persona cycles between 3 fixed texts:
- HOST: "I keep finding things I don't remember buying..."
- CHILD: "Can we play a game? A nice game?..."
- SEDUCTIVE: "The host doesn't remember what I do..."

This is a test harness limitation, not a game bug, but it means the game receives the same inputs repeatedly and STILL fails to adapt.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary: Notes Persistence Failure
The notes hidden field is either:
1. Not being generated by the LLM (the LLM omits the hidden notes element)
2. Not being extracted by `parseLLMResponse()` / `renderUI()`
3. Not being stored in `state.currentNotes`
4. Not being injected into the next prompt via `buildTurnPrompt()`

Given that this bug was supposedly fixed in commit 9325dc5, this suggests either a regression or the fix only works in certain modes.

### Secondary: Image Generation Not Triggering
The LLM appears to not generate image elements at all, despite the prompt demanding them. This could be a cost optimization, model limitation, or the response JSON is being truncated before the image elements.

### Tertiary: UI Element Variety Collapse
The prompt lists 13+ element types but the LLM only generates 5. This suggests the model falls into a minimal template pattern, especially without notes to remind it of variety requirements.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Fix notes persistence for GEEMS mode** — this is P0. Without it, the game is fundamentally broken.
2. **Enforce minimum UI element variety** — validate that each turn includes at least 2 element types not seen in the previous turn. Consider post-processing enforcement.
3. **Fix image generation** — investigate why image elements are missing from LLM output.
4. **Add stagnation detection** — if the setting hasn't changed in 3+ turns, inject a forced scene transition.
5. **Improve exhibitionism detection** — the analysis system should weight "thrill of being caught/seen" language higher for exhibitionism and lower for autassassinophilia.
6. **Text truncation** — several turns show severely truncated narrative text (Turn 9, Turn 12). Investigate token limits.
