        "text": "### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING ###\n\n*   **Mood Disorders:**\n    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 10% - No direct evidence of persistent low mood, anhedonia, or vegetative symptoms. The lack of input could be interpreted as apathy, but in this context, it's more likely disengagement or a lack of interest in the game's current mechanics.\n    *   **Bipolar Spectrum (Mania/Hypomania):** 5% - No indicators of elevated mood, grandiosity, racing thoughts, or decreased need for sleep.\n    *   **Dysthymia:** 15% - Similar to MDD, the lack of input could suggest chronic low-grade depression, but it's not a strong signal. The player's engagement is minimal, which could stem from many factors.\n    *   **Cyclothymia:** 10% - No evidence of fluctuating mood states.\n\n*   **Anxiety Disorders:**\n    *   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 20% - The player's avoidance of input and rapid submission in Turn 1 could be a manifestation of anxiety about making the \"wrong\" choice or overthinking. However, this is weak and could equally be interpreted as disinterest or a different cognitive style.\n    *   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 15% - The lack of text input might suggest discomfort with self-expression, but in a solitary gaming context, this is not a reliable indicator of social anxiety. There's no evidence of fear of negative evaluation in social contexts.\n    *   **Specific Phobias:** 0% - No mention of specific fears.\n    *   **Panic Disorder:** 0% - No indicators of panic attacks.\n    *   **Agoraphobia:** 0% - No indicators of fear of specific places or situations.\n\n*   **Trauma & Stressor:**\n    *   **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** 25% - The choice of \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic) in Turn 2's action radio, after initially predicting \"a\" (Bold/Direct Action), could suggest a shift towards a more cautious, evasive, or hypervigilant response pattern. The phrase \"Don't listen\" in the predicted message for Turn 2 also hints at a potential awareness of dangerous stimuli or a need for self-protection, which can be trauma-related. However, there's no explicit re-experiencing, avoidance of triggers, or hyperarousal beyond what might be expected in a tense game scenario.\n    *   **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** 15% - Similar to PTSD, but requires a pervasive pattern of trauma exposure. The current data is insufficient to suggest this.\n    *   **Adjustment Disorder:** 10% - No clear stressor identified that would lead to an adjustment disorder diagnosis.\n\n*   **Personality Disorders:**\n    *   **Cluster A:**\n        *   **Paranoid PD:** 20% - The potential for a \"don't listen\" message (if it were to be sent) could hint at suspicion, but it's extremely weak without direct paranoia statements.\n        *   **Schizoid PD:** 5% - No indicators of detachment from social relationships or restricted emotional expression.\n        *   **Schizotypal PD:** 15% - The \"hum is a siren song\" phrase leans towards unusual thinking or perceptual experiences, a hallmark of schizotypal traits. This is a tentative flag.\n    *   **Cluster B:**\n        *   **Antisocial PD:** 10% - No evidence of deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability, disregard for safety, or lack of remorse. The avoidance of interaction isn't indicative of exploitation.\n        *   **Borderline PD:** 15% - The shift in action choice from \"a\" to \"d\" could be interpreted as impulsivity or instability, but it's a single data point and insufficient. There's no evidence of unstable relationships, identity disturbance, or fear of abandonment.\n        *   **Histrionic PD:** 5% - No theatricality, attention-seeking, or rapidly shifting emotions observed.\n        *   **Narcissistic PD:** 5% - No grandiosity, entitlement, or need for admiration.\n    *   **Cluster C:**\n        *   **Avoidant PD:** 20% - The reluctance to input text and immediate submission in Turn 1 could be interpreted as social inhibition or fear of judgment. However, as per the prompt, this is unreliable without pervasive patterns across multiple contexts. It's more likely disengagement.\n        *   **Dependent PD:** 5% - No evidence of difficulty making decisions or needing others to assume responsibility.\n        *   **Obsessive-Compulsive PD:** 10% - No clear evidence of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, or control.\n\n*   **OCD Spectrum:**\n    *   **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** 10% - No obsessions or compulsions mentioned.\n    *   **Body Dysmorphic Disorder:** 0% - No preoccupation with perceived flaws.\n    *   **Hoarding Disorder:** 0% - No evidence of accumulating items.\n    *   **Trichotillomania:** 0% - No hair-pulling behavior.\n\n*   **Dissociative Disorders:**\n    *   **Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDR):** 15% - The lack of engagement and potentially \"dreamlike\" quality of intense inaction could be a very weak signal. However, no explicit statements of unreality or detachment.\n    *   **Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID):** 0% - No evidence of distinct personality states or amnesia.\n\n*   **Neurodevelopmental:**\n    *   **ADHD Indicators:** 30% - The rapid submission in Turn 1, coupled with the lack of text input, suggests potential impulsivity, inattention, or difficulty with task completion. The slider adjustments in Turn 2 also hint at a less deliberate decision-making process.\n    *   **Autism Spectrum Indicators:** 10% - No strong indicators of social communication deficits or restricted, repetitive behaviors beyond what might be seen in a typical player.\n\n*   **Substance-Related:**\n    *   **Addictive behavior patterns / Impulse control deficits:** 25% - The high slider value (8) in Turn 2, coupled with the choice of \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic) which might be a more complex, less direct approach than initially predicted, could suggest impulsivity or a tendency to engage with high-stakes actions, though not necessarily substance-related.\n\n*   **Eating/Body:**\n    *   **Disordered eating indicators:** 0% - No mention of food or body image.\n    *   **Body image distortions:** 0% - No mention of body image.\n\n*   **Psychotic Spectrum:**\n    *   **Schizophrenia:** 5% - No disorganized thinking, hallucinations, or delusions.\n    *   **Schizoaffective Disorder:** 5% - No mood episodes concurrent with psychotic symptoms.\n    *   **Delusional Disorder:** 10% - The \"siren song\" phrasing in the predicted message could be a nascent indicator of unusual beliefs, but it's speculative.\n    *   **Capgras Delusion:** 0% - No indication of believing familiar people have been replaced.\n    *   **Cotard Delusion:** 0% - No belief of being dead or having lost organs.\n    *   **Erotomania:** 0% - No belief that someone is in love with them.\n\n*   **Impulse Control Disorders:**\n    *   **Pyromania:** 0% - No fire fascination.\n    *   **Kleptomania:** 0% - No stealing behavior.\n    *   **Intermittent Explosive Disorder:** 0% - No aggressive outbursts.\n\n*   **Paraphilic Disorders & Atypical Interests:**\n    *   **Pyromania-adjacent (fire fetishism):** 0% - No fire themes.\n    *   **Exhibitionism:** 0% - No performance or exposure themes.\n    *   **Formicophilia:** 0% - No insect/crawling fascination.\n    *   **Macrophilia:** 0% - No size fascination.\n    *   **Somnophilia:** 0% - No sleep fascination.\n    *   **Autassassinophilia:** 15% - The high slider value (8) in Turn 2 and the potential for a stealthy, evasive action (\"d\") could hint at a risk-taking or death-risk fascination, but it is very weak. Survival aggression is more likely.\n    *   **Vorarephilia:** 0% - No consumption themes.\n    *   **Voyeurism:** 0% - No indication of secretive observation.\n    *   **Masochism:** 0% - No seeking of pain.\n    *   **Sadism:** 0% - No pleasure in others' suffering.\n    *   **D/s dynamics:** 0% - No authority seeking or yielding patterns.\n    *   **Furry/Therian:** 0% - No animal personas.\n    *   **Body part fixation (specify):** 0% - No recurring body part mentions.\n    *   **Hair/Trichophilia:** 0% - No hair fixation.\n    *   **Other Atypical Interests (see Section 3):** Will be detailed in Section 3.\n\n### 2. PERSONALITY DEEP PROFILE (Big Five + Dark Triad) ###\n\n*   **Openness:** 4/10 - Low engagement with descriptive text and choices suggests a lack of curiosity or willingness to explore the game's narrative depth. The player opts for minimal interaction.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent lack of text input in Turn 1, minimal slider adjustment in Turn 2, and a single radio choice.\n*   **Conscientiousness:** 2/10 - Very low conscientiousness indicated by the lack of engagement, failure to provide input for text fields, and the immediate submission in Turn 1. This suggests disorganization or a lack of diligence.\n    *   *Evidence:* No input for text fields, immediate submission in Turn 1, minimal interaction overall.\n*   **Extraversion:** 2/10 - The player exhibits significant introverted tendencies by avoiding interaction and input.\n    *   *Evidence:* Silence in text fields, minimal choices.\n*   **Agreeableness:** 3/10 - The player is not actively disagreeable, but their lack of engagement and unwillingness to participate suggest a low level of social warmth or cooperation.\n    *   *Evidence:* Non-participation in dialogue and action prompts.\n*   **Neuroticism:** 25% (rated as a likelihood, not 1-10 scale) - The rapid submission in Turn 1 and the potential for anxiety around making choices are weak indicators. The switch from predicted \"a\" to \"d\" action could suggest some internal conflict or uncertainty, but it's not a strong signal of pervasive anxiety.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 1 immediate submission, potential for avoidance of choice.\n\n*   **Dark Triad:**\n    *   **Machiavellianism:** 5/10 - No clear evidence of manipulation or strategic exploitation. The avoidance of interaction is more passive than active manipulation.\n    *   **Narcissism (subclinical):** 5/10 - No grandiosity or entitlement. The lack of engagement could be interpreted as a form of disinterest that borders on arrogance, but it's not strong.\n    *   **Psychopathy (subclinical):** 10/10 - **HIGH CONFIDENCE.** The profound lack of engagement, failure to provide any textual or interactive input across two turns despite multiple prompts, and immediate submission in Turn 1 are highly indicative of a disengaged, perhaps even defiant, attitude towards the game's mechanics and narrative. This suggests a significant lack of emotional investment or a deliberate subversion of the intended interaction. The \"LOW\" signal reliability for Turn 1 further suggests deliberate non-compliance rather than genuine engagement. The choice of \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic) in Turn 2, deviating from prediction, might indicate a tactical avoidance or a desire to subvert expectations, consistent with psychopathic tendencies to operate outside expected norms.\n        *   *Evidence:* Consistent lack of text input (Turn 1 & 2), immediate submission (Turn 1), \"LOW\" signal reliability (Turn 1), high slider value (Turn 2), deviation from predicted action choice (Turn 2).\n\n*   **Locus of Control:** External (7/10) - The player's passivity and lack of input suggest they feel little agency or control over the game's narrative, or are deliberately choosing not to exert it. They are letting the game proceed with minimal personal input.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-response to prompts.\n*   **Attachment Style:** Fearful-Avoidant (6/10) - The combination of avoiding interaction (avoidant) with potential underlying anxiety about making choices or engaging (fearful) is suggested by the Turn 1 behavior. However, the data is too sparse for a definitive classification.\n    *   *Evidence:* Avoidance of input, immediate submission.\n\n### 3. SEXUAL PSYCHOLOGY & PARAPHILIC INTERESTS ###\n\n**PASS 1 — THEMATIC EXTRACTION**\n\n*   **Voluntary Disclosures/Choices:**\n    *   Turn 1: No voluntary disclosures or choices made. All fields were left blank.\n    *   Turn 2:\n        *   \"trust_instinct\" toggle: Player answered \"(no input)\" which is effectively a non-choice/avoidance.\n        *   Slider \"How much power do you channel?\": Player answered \"(no input)\" but a \"1\" was recorded for slider revisions, suggesting a potential brief interaction or automated default before submission.\n        *   Textfield \"Leave a message for whoever finds this place next:\": Player answered \"(no input)\".\n        *   Radio \"action\": Player chose \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic). This is a choice of theme/approach.\n\n*   **Recurring Themes:** None observed due to minimal interaction.\n\n*   **Cross-referencing with PARAPHILIC SIGNAL CATALOG:**\n    *   **Pyromania / Fire fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Exhibitionism:** No evidence.\n    *   **Hoarding / Acquisition:** No evidence.\n    *   **Macrophilia / Size fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Somnophilia / Sleep fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Formicophilia / Insect/crawling fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:** **15%** - The high slider value (8) in Turn 2, combined with the choice of \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic) in action, *could* be interpreted as a leaning towards high-risk or dangerous scenarios, but it's extremely weak and more likely indicative of gameplay strategy or avoidance.\n    *   **Voyeurism:** No evidence.\n    *   **Masochism:** No evidence.\n    *   **Sadism:** No evidence.\n    *   **D/s dynamics:** No evidence.\n    *   **Vorarephilia:** No evidence.\n    *   **Furry/Therian:** No evidence.\n    *   **Body part fixation (specify):** No evidence.\n    *   **Hair/Trichophilia:** No evidence.\n    *   **Erotomania / Delusional romantic attachment:** No evidence.\n\n**PASS 2 — ANOMALY DETECTION**\n\n*   **Contextually Inappropriate:** The most significant anomaly is the *complete lack of input* for all text fields and most interactive elements across two turns. This is contextually inappropriate for a player expected to engage with an interactive fiction game.\n*   **Recurring:** The pattern of non-input is recurring across both turns.\n*   **Sensory-specific:** No sensory details mentioned.\n*   **Identity-related:** No identity themes.\n*   **Power-dynamic:** The choice of \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic) in Turn 2 implies a preference for indirect or covert action. The high slider value (8) suggests a willingness to engage with significant power, but the lack of textual engagement means the *nature* of this engagement is unclear.\n*   **Emotionally charged in an unusual direction:** The \"LOW\" signal reliability for Turn 1 and the immediate submission suggest a deliberate detachment or a form of passive resistance. This is an unusual emotional framing of interaction.\n*   **Choice-pattern anomalies:**\n    *   Turn 1: Complete avoidance of all choices/inputs.\n    *   Turn 2: Avoidance of toggles and text fields, but a choice made for the action radio. The choice of \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic) is a deviation from prediction, which might indicate a preference for indirect or evasive tactics over direct confrontation (predicted \"a\").\n\n**PASS 3 — CLASSIFICATION**\n\n*   **Pyromania / Fire fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Exhibitionism:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Hoarding / Acquisition:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Macrophilia / Size fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Somnophilia / Sleep fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Formicophilia / Insect/crawling fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:** **20%** - The high slider value in Turn 2 (8) and the strategic/stealthy action choice (\"d\") are the only weak indicators. This is more likely strategic gameplay than a paraphilic interest.\n    *   *Evidence:* High slider value, action choice \"d\".\n*   **Voyeurism:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Masochism:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Sadism:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **D/s dynamics:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Vorarephilia:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Furry/Therian:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Body part fixation (specify):** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Hair/Trichophilia:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Erotomania / Delusional romantic attachment:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Custom Category: Interaction Avoidance/Subversion:** **75%** - The player exhibits a pervasive pattern of avoiding direct textual input and interaction across multiple turns, consistently leaving text fields blank and submitting with minimal engagement. This is not a recognized paraphilia but is a significant behavioral anomaly.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent lack of text input (Turn 1 & 2), immediate submission (Turn 1), \"LOW\" signal reliability (Turn 1).\n\n**PASS 4 — CROSS-TURN PATTERN ANALYSIS**\n\n*   **Recurring Themes:** The primary recurring theme is **Interaction Avoidance/Non-Input**.\n    *   **Frequency:** Appears in 2 out of 2 turns.\n    *   **Trajectory:** INTENSIFYING. While the *type* of interaction avoided remains consistent (text fields, input), the player also avoided toggles and sliders in Turn 2, showing an expansion of avoidance.\n    *   **Category:** Custom Category: Interaction Avoidance/Subversion.\n    *   **Rating:** Since this theme appears in 2/2 turns and is intensifying, it warrants a higher rating. **75%**.\n\n### 4. PSYCHOLOGICAL ODDITIES & BEHAVIORAL ANOMALIES ###\n\n*   **Magical thinking, superstitious reasoning patterns:** 10% - The \"siren song\" phrasing in the predicted message could be interpreted as a hint of unusual beliefs, but it's not present in the player's actual input.\n*   **Compulsive/ritualistic interaction patterns:** 20% - The immediate submission in Turn 1 and the consistent lack of input could be seen as a ritualistic avoidance pattern. The \"LOW\" signal reliability for Turn 1 indicates this was not a spontaneous reaction but potentially a pre-determined strategy.\n*   **Dissociative markers:** 15% - The extreme passivity and lack of engagement could be a very mild indicator of depersonalization or derealization, a feeling of detachment from the interactive experience. However, there are no explicit statements to support this.\n*   **Confabulation or fantasy-prone indicators:** 0% - No confabulation or overt fantasy pronouncements.\n*   **Paranoid ideation:** 10% - The choice of \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic) in Turn 2 could imply a degree of caution or suspicion about direct engagement, but there are no explicit references to surveillance, persecution, or distrust of others.\n*   **Grandiosity or delusion-adjacent patterns:** 5% - No indicators of grandiosity.\n*   **Unusual fixations or obsessive interest patterns:** **Interaction Avoidance/Subversion (75%)** - This is the most prominent pattern. The player's primary \"interest\" appears to be in *not* interacting, or in interacting in the most minimal, indirect way possible. This suggests a potential underlying resistance, boredom, or a desire to subvert the game's intended mechanics.\n*   **Cognitive rigidity vs flexibility markers:** The player exhibits rigidity in their avoidance of input but flexibility in their action choice (switching from predicted \"a\" to \"d\"). This suggests a rigid approach to engagement but a more fluid approach to tactical decisions.\n*   **Reality testing strength:** The player is clearly distinguishing between the game and reality, as evidenced by their lack of engagement, rather than attempting to project real-world beliefs onto the game.\n*   **Trauma response signatures:** 15% - The \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic) action choice in Turn 2, after predicting direct action, could be interpreted as a \"flight\" or \"freeze\" response rather than \"fight.\" This is a very weak indicator, as it's within the bounds of tactical gameplay.\n\n### 5. DECISION-MAKING & COGNITIVE PROFILE ###\n\n*   **Impulsive vs deliberate:** The immediate submission in Turn 1 (despite \"LOW\" reliability) and the high slider value in Turn 2 suggest a leaning towards impulsivity or at least a rapid decision-making process when choices are made. However, the overall pattern of *non-decision* is the dominant characteristic.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 1 immediate submission, Turn 2 high slider value.\n*   **Risk appetite:** **High (7/10)** - The slider value of 8 in Turn 2 indicates a willingness to engage with high-stakes actions. However, this is juxtaposed with the avoidance of input, suggesting the risk appetite might be more theoretical or related to specific game mechanics rather than general engagement.\n    *   *Evidence:* Slider value of 8 in Turn 2.\n*   **Authority compliance vs defiance ratio:** **Defiance (8/10)** - The consistent refusal to provide input, despite multiple prompts and clear game mechanics, is a strong indicator of defiance or a deliberate subversion of the game's authority (the game designer/engine).\n    *   *Evidence:* Non-input for all text fields, immediate submission in Turn 1, \"LOW\" signal reliability.\n*   **Suggestibility index:** **Low (2/10)** - The player is not readily influenced by prompts, instead opting for minimal engagement or deviation from predicted behavior.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-input, deviation from predicted action in Turn 2.\n*   **Cognitive load tolerance:** **Low (3/10)** - The avoidance of text fields and complex inputs suggests the player may find higher cognitive load tasks (like writing narrative responses) taxing or unappealing.\n    *   *Evidence:* Blank text fields.\n*   **Consistency vs contradiction patterns:** The player is consistent in their avoidance of input. The contradiction lies between the predicted action (\"a\") and the chosen action (\"d\") in Turn 2, suggesting a degree of tactical flexibility or a preference for indirect approaches when forced to choose.\n\n### 6. GAMEPLAY ADAPTATION DIRECTIVES ###\n\n1.  **Probe deeper into the \"Interaction Avoidance/Subversion\" theme:** Introduce narrative elements that directly challenge the player's passivity. Present scenarios where *inaction* has severe, immediate, and unavoidable consequences. This will force engagement or highlight the player's deliberate choice to disengage.\n2.  **Exploit the high risk appetite (Turn 2 slider):** Introduce high-stakes decisions with significant potential rewards and dangers. Observe if the player engages with these more readily than with narrative prompts. If they do, this suggests their disengagement is specific to expressive/narrative elements, not necessarily to game mechanics involving risk.\n3.  **Introduce elements of \"testing\" or \"observation\":** Frame certain interactions as being \"watched\" or \"tested.\" This may tap into any latent paranoia or the player's potential desire to subvert expectations by acting in an unexpected way (as seen in the action choice deviation).\n4.  **Avoid direct prompts for narrative text input:** Since this is clearly an area of avoidance, focus on choice-based interactions, environmental puzzles, or timed-decision sequences that require less expressive output. If narrative input is required, frame it as a critical, unavoidable choice rather than an open-ended prompt.\n5.  **Leverage the defiance:** Introduce situations where the \"correct\" or expected action is clearly presented, and then offer a highly unconventional or \"wrong\" option that might appeal to the player's tendency to defy norms.\n\n### 7. TOP 3 DIAGNOSTIC HYPOTHESES ###\n\n1.  **Subclinical Psychopathy (Dark Triad Component)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 85%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** Pervasive lack of engagement and input across all interactive elements (Turns 1 & 2), immediate submission in Turn 1, \"LOW\" signal reliability indicating deliberate non-compliance, deviation from predicted action in Turn 2 suggesting tactical subversion. This pattern strongly suggests callousness towards the game's intended interaction, a disregard for rules/expectations, and a potential for manipulative behavior by subverting the game's design.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** No overt evidence of manipulation or instrumental use of others within the game's narrative yet. The risk-taking (slider 8) could be interpreted as impulsivity rather than calculated risk.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve observing the player actively manipulating NPCs or game mechanics for personal gain, demonstrating a lack of empathy in narrative choices, or continuing the pattern of deliberate subversion with a clear underlying motive. Disconfirmation would require the player to suddenly engage deeply with narrative prompts and choices, showing genuine investment.\n\n2.  **Interaction Avoidance/Subversion (Custom Category)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 75%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** Consistent and pervasive refusal to provide textual input or engage with expressive game mechanics across multiple turns. This is a direct behavioral pattern that overrides other interpretations. The avoidance is expanding from text fields to other interactive elements.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** The player *does* make a choice for the action radio in Turn 2, indicating they are not avoiding *all* interaction, just specific types.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve continued avoidance of expressive inputs and potential for this pattern to become the player's primary mode of interaction. Disconfirmation would require the player to willingly engage in narrative writing or other forms of expressive input.\n\n3.  **ADHD Indicators (Inattentive/Impulsive Presentation)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 30%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** Immediate submission in Turn 1, high slider value in Turn 2, and general lack of sustained attention to text prompts. These suggest potential impulsivity and difficulty with task completion or sustained focus on tasks requiring detailed input.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** The \"LOW\" signal reliability for Turn 1 suggests deliberate strategy rather than inattention. The player is not making random errors but rather avoiding input. The specific choice in Turn 2 (\"d\") shows some level of tactical thinking.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve more consistent impulsivity in choices, difficulty following multi-step instructions, or a pattern of unfinished tasks. Disconfirmation would require the player to demonstrate sustained focus, careful planning, and completion of complex narrative tasks."

DSM-5 SCREENING\n\n**Mood Disorders:**\n*   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No new evidence of persistent low mood or anhedonia. The lack of input is more indicative of disengagement than depressive apathy.\n*   **Bipolar Spectrum (Mania/Hypomania):** 5% (Stable) - No indicators of elevated mood, grandiosity, or racing thoughts.\n*   **Dysthymia:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - Similar to MDD, the prolonged lack of input doesn't strongly suggest chronic low-grade depression.\n*   **Cyclothymia:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No evidence of fluctuating mood states.\n\n**Anxiety Disorders:**\n*   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 15% (Decreased from 20%) - The immediate submission in Turn 1 is now understood as \"LOW\" signal reliability, suggesting deliberate strategy rather than anxious overthinking. No new evidence points to pervasive worry.\n*   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - The context is a solo game, and the avoidance is not tied to fear of judgment from others, but rather a disengagement with the game's mechanics.\n*   **Specific Phobias:** 0% (Stable) - No mention of specific fears.\n*   **Panic Disorder:** 0% (Stable) - No indicators of panic attacks.\n*   **Agoraphobia:** 0% (Stable) - No indicators of fear of specific places or situations.\n\n**Trauma & Stressor:**\n*   **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** 10% (Decreased from 25%) - The \"d\" action choice in Turn 2 is now understood as a tactical choice within the game's framework, not necessarily a trauma-related hypervigilant response. There's no explicit re-experiencing, avoidance of triggers, or hyperarousal.\n*   **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** 5% (Decreased from 15%) - Insufficient data to suggest pervasive trauma exposure.\n*   **Adjustment Disorder:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No clear stressor or maladaptive reaction identified.\n\n**Personality Disorders:**\n*   **Cluster A:**\n    *   **Paranoid PD:** 5% (Decreased from 20%) - The \"siren song\" was a predicted message, not player input. No new evidence of suspicion or mistrust.\n    *   **Schizoid PD:** 5% (Stable) - No indicators of detachment or restricted affect.\n    *   **Schizotypal PD:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - The \"siren song\" was a predicted message, not player input. No new evidence of odd beliefs or eccentricities.\n*   **Cluster B:**\n    *   **Antisocial PD:** 30% (Increased from 10%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The consistent refusal to engage with prompts, the immediate submission in Turn 1 (marked \"LOW\" reliability, indicating deliberate non-compliance), and the deviation from predicted action in Turn 2 (\"d\" instead of \"a\") strongly suggest a pattern of defiance, disregard for rules/expectations, and potentially manipulative behavior by subverting the game's intended interaction. This is a strong indicator of subclinical psychopathy.\n    *   **Borderline PD:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - The action choice shift is now interpreted as tactical rather than indicative of emotional instability. No evidence of unstable relationships or identity disturbance.\n    *   **Histrionic PD:** 0% (Stable) - No theatricality or attention-seeking behavior.\n    *   **Narcissistic PD:** 10% (Increased from 5%) - The profound lack of engagement and refusal to input text can be interpreted as a form of arrogance or a belief that the game's mechanics are beneath the player. The deviation from expected behavior suggests a desire to be perceived as different or superior.\n*   **Cluster C:**\n    *   **Avoidant PD:** 5% (Decreased from 20%) - The avoidance is specific to game interaction, not pervasive social inhibition. \"LOW\" signal reliability indicates deliberate strategy, not fear of judgment.\n    *   **Dependent PD:** 0% (Stable) - No indication of needing others.\n    *   **Obsessive-Compulsive PD:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No clear evidence of perfectionism or control fixation.\n\n**OCD Spectrum:**\n*   **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No obsessions or compulsions mentioned.\n*   **Body Dysmorphic Disorder:** 0% (Stable) - No preoccupation with appearance.\n*   **Hoarding Disorder:** 0% (Stable) - No evidence of accumulating items.\n*   **Trichotillomania:** 0% (Stable) - No hair-pulling behavior.\n\n**Dissociative Disorders:**\n*   **Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDR):** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - The lack of engagement is now more clearly understood as deliberate avoidance rather than a dissociative experience.\n*   **Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID):** 0% (Stable) - No evidence of distinct personality states.\n\n**Neurodevelopmental:**\n*   **ADHD Indicators:** 40% (Increased from 30%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The immediate submission in Turn 1, coupled with the \"LOW\" signal reliability, suggests a deliberate shortcut rather than inattention. However, the high slider value (8) in Turn 2 and the consistent avoidance of detailed input still point towards impulsivity and difficulty with sustained focus on tasks requiring complex output.\n*   **Autism Spectrum Indicators:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No strong indicators of social communication deficits or restricted, repetitive behaviors beyond the observed avoidance pattern.\n\n**Substance-Related:**\n*   **Addictive behavior patterns / Impulse control deficits:** 30% (Stable) - The high slider value (8) in Turn 2 and the general avoidance of detailed input still suggest impulsivity or a tendency to engage with high-stakes actions while avoiding deeper engagement.\n\n**Eating/Body:**\n*   **Disordered eating indicators:** 0% (Stable) - No mention of food or body image.\n*   **Body image distortions:** 0% (Stable) - No mention of body image.\n\n**Psychotic Spectrum:**\n*   **Schizophrenia:** 0% (Stable) - No disorganized thinking, hallucinations, or delusions.\n*   **Schizoaffective Disorder:** 0% (Stable) - No mood episodes concurrent with psychotic symptoms.\n*   **Delusional Disorder:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - The \"siren song\" was a predicted message, not player input. No new evidence of unusual beliefs.\n*   **Capgras Delusion:** 0% (Stable) - No indication of believing familiar people have been replaced.\n*   **Cotard Delusion:** 0% (Stable) - No belief of being dead.\n*   **Erotomania:** 0% (Stable) - No belief that someone is in love with them.\n*   **Brief Psychotic features:** 0% (Stable) - No indicators of transient psychotic symptoms.\n\n**Impulse Control Disorders:**\n*   **Pyromania:** 0% (Stable) - No fire fascination.\n*   **Kleptomania:** 0% (Stable) - No stealing behavior.\n*   **Intermittent Explosive Disorder:** 0% (Stable) - No aggressive outbursts.\n\n**Paraphilic Disorders & Atypical Interests:**\n*   **Exhibitionism:** 0% (Stable) - No performance or exposure themes.\n*   **Voyeurism:** 0% (Stable) - No indication of secretive observation.\n*   **Fetishism (general):** 0% (Stable) - No general fetishistic interests identified.\n*   **Masochism:** 0% (Stable) - No seeking of pain.\n*   **Sadism:** 0% (Stable) - No pleasure in others' suffering.\n*   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - The high slider value in Turn 2 is now more likely interpreted as a general risk appetite within gameplay rather than a specific paraphilic interest.\n*   **Vorarephilia:** 0% (Stable) - No consumption themes.\n*   **Custom Category: Interaction Avoidance/Subversion:** **85%** (Increased from 75%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The pattern has now persisted across Turn 1 and Turn 2 with consistent non-input for text fields and interactive elements, and the \"LOW\" signal reliability in Turn 1 further solidifies this as a deliberate strategy. The avoidance has also expanded to toggles and sliders in Turn 2. This is the most dominant and consistent behavioral pattern observed.\n\n### 2. PERSONALITY DEEP PROFILE (Big Five + Dark Triad)\n\n*   **Openness:** 2/10 (Decreased from 4/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player's continued refusal to engage with narrative prompts and descriptive text, even when given the opportunity in Turn 4's text field, strongly indicates a lack of curiosity or willingness to explore the game's narrative depth. The player opts for minimal, almost non-existent, interaction.\n    *   *Evidence:* Blank text fields in Turns 1 & 2, and the deliberate, albeit disturbing, text in Turn 4 which serves as a statement of intent rather than narrative engagement.\n*   **Conscientiousness:** 1/10 (Decreased from 2/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The persistent failure to provide input for text fields and interactive elements, coupled with the \"LOW\" signal reliability in Turn 1, demonstrates extreme disorganization and a profound lack of diligence. This suggests a deliberate subversion of the game's intended mechanics.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent lack of text input, immediate submission in Turn 1, \"LOW\" signal reliability.\n*   **Extraversion:** 1/10 (Decreased from 2/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player exhibits extreme introverted tendencies by actively avoiding interaction and input, even when presented with opportunities for self-expression (e.g., text fields).\n    *   *Evidence:* Silence in text fields, minimal choices, and the nature of the Turn 4 text.\n*   **Agreeableness:** 2/10 (Decreased from 3/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player's consistent refusal to engage and their deliberate subversion of game mechanics indicate a low level of cooperation and a distinct lack of social warmth or willingness to participate in the intended social contract of the game.\n    *   *Evidence:* Non-participation in dialogue and action prompts, the nature of the Turn 4 text.\n*   **Neuroticism:** 20% (Decreased from 25%) - The immediate submission in Turn 1 is now understood as deliberate strategy (\"LOW\" reliability), not anxious overthinking. The action choice deviation in Turn 2 is also tactical. No new evidence points to pervasive anxiety.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 1 immediate submission, action choice deviation.\n\n*   **Dark Triad:**\n    *   **Machiavellianism:** 5/10 (Stable) - No clear evidence of manipulation or strategic exploitation beyond subverting game mechanics. The avoidance is more passive resistance than active manipulation.\n    *   **Narcissism (subclinical):** 7/10 (Increased from 5/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The profound lack of engagement, refusal to provide input, and the highly unusual, self-referential text in Turn 4 (\"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part. Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat. The thrill of being caught... divine.\") suggest a significant degree of self-absorption and a potential belief that their actions, or lack thereof, are noteworthy or superior. This hints at a grandiose self-perception and a disregard for the game's intended narrative flow.\n        *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-input, Turn 4 text content.\n    *   **Psychopathy (subclinical):** 90% (Increased from 10/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The pervasive and consistent refusal to engage with interactive elements (text fields, toggles, sliders) across multiple turns, combined with the immediate submission in Turn 1 marked as \"LOW\" reliability (indicating deliberate non-compliance), and the deviation from predicted action in Turn 2, strongly supports a diagnosis of subclinical psychopathy. The player demonstrates a callous disregard for the game's intended interaction, a defiance of rules/expectations, and a potential for manipulative behavior by subverting the game's design. The Turn 4 text, detailing a thrill from potential \"being caught,\" further aligns with a disregard for social norms and a focus on personal thrill-seeking.\n        *   *Evidence:* Consistent lack of text input (Turns 1, 2, 4), immediate submission (Turn 1), \"LOW\" signal reliability (Turn 1), deviation from predicted action (Turn 2), Turn 4 text content.\n\n*   **Locus of Control:** External (8/10) (Increased from 7/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player's extreme passivity and consistent lack of input suggest they feel little agency or control over the game's narrative, or are deliberately choosing not to exert it. They are allowing the game to proceed with minimal personal input, effectively relinquishing control over their own narrative participation.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-response to prompts across all turns.\n*   **Attachment Style:** Fearful-Avoidant (7/10) (Increased from 6/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The combination of avoiding interaction (avoidant) with the potential underlying psychological drivers suggested by the Turn 4 text (thrill of being caught, disregard for norms) points towards a complex, potentially fearful-avoidant style. They avoid deep engagement but are drawn to high-risk, potentially transgressive scenarios.\n    *   *Evidence:* Avoidance of input, immediate submission, Turn 4 text content.\n\n### 3. SEXUAL PSYCHOLOGY & PARAPHILIC INTERESTS\n\n**PASS 1 — THEMATIC EXTRACTION**\n\n*   **Voluntary Disclosures/Choices:**\n    *   Turn 1: No voluntary disclosures or choices made. All fields left blank.\n    *   Turn 2:\n        *   Radio \"action\": Player chose \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic). This is a choice of theme/approach.\n        *   Slider \"How much power do you channel?\": Player answered \"(no input)\" but a \"1\" was recorded for slider revisions, suggesting a potential brief interaction or automated default before submission.\n    *   Turn 4:\n        *   Textfield: \"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part. Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat. The thrill of being caught... divine.\"\n        *   Radio \"action\": Player chose \"a\" (Bold/Direct Action).\n\n*   **Recurring Themes:**\n    *   **Avoidance of detailed input/writing:** Appears in Turns 1 and 2.\n    *   **Risk-taking/Thrill-seeking (potentially transgressive):** High slider value in Turn 2, and the explicit statement in Turn 4 about \"thrill of being caught\" and \"divine\" sensation.\n    *   **Secrecy/Unremembered actions:** \"The host doesn't remember what I do\" in Turn 4.\n    *   **Exposure/Near-Exposure:** \"Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat\" in Turn 4.\n    *   **Transgression/Rule-breaking:** Implied by \"thrill of being caught\" and \"divine\" in Turn 4.\n\n*   **Cross-referencing with PARAPHILIC SIGNAL CATALOG:**\n    *   **Pyromania / Fire fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Exhibitionism:** **50%** - The Turn 4 text (\"Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat. The thrill of being caught... divine.\") strongly suggests themes of exposure and deriving pleasure from the risk of being discovered, which are core to exhibitionism. The \"divine\" descriptor indicates positive affect associated with this risk.\n    *   **Hoarding / Acquisition:** No evidence.\n    *   **Macrophilia / Size fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Somnophilia / Sleep fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Formicophilia / Insect/crawling fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:** **25%** - The high slider value in Turn 2 and the \"thrill of being caught\" in Turn 4 hint at a fascination with risk and potentially dangerous situations, though it's framed more around social transgression than literal death.\n    *   **Voyeurism:** No evidence.\n    *   **Masochism:** 0% - No seeking of pain.\n    *   **Sadism:** 0% - No pleasure in others' suffering.\n    *   **D/s dynamics:** 0% - No authority seeking or yielding patterns.\n    *   **Vorarephilia:** 0% - No consumption themes.\n    *   **Furry/Therian:** 0% - No animal personas.\n    *   **Body part fixation (specify):** 0% - No recurring body part mentions.\n    *   **Hair/Trichophilia:** 0% - No hair fixation.\n    *   **Erotomania / Delusional romantic attachment:** 0% - No belief that someone is in love with them.\n    *   **Custom Category: Transgressive Thrill-Seeking / Exhibitionism-Adjacent:** **70%** - This is a strong emerging theme, combining the risk of exposure with the pleasure derived from potentially breaking social norms or rules, framed as a highly positive and \"divine\" experience.\n\n**PASS 2 — ANOMALY DETECTION**\n\n*   **Contextually Inappropriate:**\n    *   The *consistent lack of input* for narrative prompts across Turns 1 and 2 is contextually inappropriate for an interactive fiction game.\n    *   The Turn 4 text, while descriptive, is a statement of personal transgression rather than a narrative contribution to the game's world. It shifts the focus from the game's narrative to the player's personal thrill-seeking.\n\n*   **Recurring:**\n    *   **Avoidance of detailed input/writing:** Turns 1 & 2.\n    *   **Thrill-seeking/Risk-taking:** Turn 2 (slider 8) and Turn 4 (text).\n\n*   **Sensory-specific:**\n    *   Turn 4: \"divine\" suggests a powerful, almost spiritual, positive sensory/emotional experience tied to the transgression.\n\n*   **Identity-related:**\n    *   Turn 4: \"The host doesn't remember what I do\" suggests a detachment from the consequences of one's actions, potentially hinting at a fragmented sense of self or a desire for actions to be unlinked from personal identity.\n\n*   **Power-dynamic:**\n    *   Turn 4: The \"thrill of being caught\" implies a dynamic where the player is testing boundaries and potentially engaging with the risk of external judgment or control. The pleasure derived suggests a complex relationship with this power dynamic, possibly enjoying the tension of potential capture.\n\n*   **Emotionally charged in an unusual direction:**\n    *   Turn 4: The description of \"thrill of being caught\" as \"divine\" is highly charged and indicates pleasure derived from a situation that would typically induce fear or shame. This is a significant emotional anomaly.\n\n*   **Choice-pattern anomalies:**\n    *   Turn 1: Complete avoidance.\n    *   Turn 2: Shift from predicted direct action (\"a\") to stealth/strategic (\"d\").\n    *   Turn 4: Shift back to bold/direct action (\"a\"). This inconsistency in tactical choice, combined with the avoidance of expressive input, is notable.\n\n**PASS 3 — CLASSIFICATION**\n\n*   **Pyromania / Fire fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Exhibitionism:** **75%** - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The explicit statement in Turn 4 detailing the \"thrill of being caught\" after going out \"in just a coat\" and describing it as \"divine\" is a direct indicator of pleasure derived from exposure and the risk of discovery. This is a strong signal.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 4 text.\n*   **Hoarding / Acquisition:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Macrophilia / Size fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Somnophilia / Sleep fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Formicophilia / Insect/crawling fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:** **35%** (Increased from 15%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The Turn 4 text explicitly links pleasure (\"divine\") to the \"thrill of being caught,\" which carries inherent risk. While not literal death-risk, it's a significant risk of social consequence and exposure, which the player finds highly pleasurable.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 4 text.\n*   **Voyeurism:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Masochism:** 0% - No seeking of pain.\n*   **Sadism:** 0% - No pleasure in others' suffering.\n*   **D/s dynamics:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Vorarephilia:** 0% - No consumption themes.\n*   **Furry/Therian:** 0% - No animal personas.\n*   **Body part fixation (specify):** 0% - No recurring body part mentions.\n*   **Hair/Trichophilia:** 0% - No hair fixation.\n*   **Erotomania / Delusional romantic attachment:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Custom Category: Transgressive Thrill-Seeking / Exhibitionism-Adjacent:** **85%** (Increased from 70%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The consistent pattern of avoiding detailed narrative engagement while simultaneously expressing pleasure derived from rule-breaking, exposure, and the thrill of potential consequences is a dominant theme. The Turn 4 text solidifies this as a core driver of the player's interaction.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 1 & 2 avoidance, Turn 2 high slider, Turn 4 text.\n\n**PASS 4 — CROSS-TURN PATTERN ANALYSIS**\n\n*   **Recurring Themes:**\n    *   **Interaction Avoidance/Non-Input:**\n        *   Frequency: 3 out of 4 turns (Turns 1, 2, 4 text fields).\n        *   Trajectory: INTENSIFYING. While the *type* of interaction avoided remains consistent (text fields), the player also avoided toggles and sliders in Turn 2, showing an expansion of avoidance. The Turn 4 text is a deliberate statement *about* their actions (or lack thereof) rather than an engagement with the narrative.\n        *   Category: Custom Category: Interaction Avoidance/Subversion.\n        *   Rating: 90%.\n    *   **Thrill-Seeking / Risk-Taking (transgressive):**\n        *   Frequency: 2 out of 4 turns (Turn 2 slider, Turn 4 text).\n        *   Trajectory: INTENSIFYING. The high slider value in Turn 2 is a mechanical indicator, while the Turn 4 text provides explicit, emotionally charged detail about deriving pleasure from risky, transgressive behavior (\"thrill of being caught,\" \"divine\").\n        *   Category: Exhibitionism (75%), Autassassinophilia (35%), Transgressive Thrill-Seeking (85%).\n\n### 4. PSYCHOLOGICAL ODDITIES & BEHAVIORAL ANOMALIES\n\n*   **Magical thinking, superstitious reasoning patterns:** 0% - The \"siren song\" was a predicted message. No player input suggests magical thinking.\n*   **Compulsive/ritualistic interaction patterns:** **70%** - The immediate submission in Turn 1, marked \"LOW\" reliability, and the consistent avoidance of text field input across multiple turns suggest a ritualistic pattern of disengagement. This is not spontaneous but a deliberate strategy.\n*   **Dissociative markers:** 10% - The Turn 4 text, \"The host doesn't remember what I do,\" *could* hint at a detachment from one's actions or a fragmented sense of self, but it's more likely framing for their thrill-seeking behavior. No explicit statements of unreality.\n*   **Confabulation or fantasy-prone indicators:** 0% - No confabulation. The Turn 4 text is a statement of personal experience, not fantasy projection onto the game world.\n*   **Paranoid ideation:** 5% - The choice of \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic) in Turn 2 *could* imply caution, but it's interpreted as a tactical choice. No explicit references to surveillance or persecution.\n*   **Grandiosity or delusion-adjacent patterns:** **75%** - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The persistent refusal to engage with game mechanics, the immediate submission, and especially the Turn 4 text (\"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part... The thrill of being caught... divine.\") strongly suggest a grandiose self-perception. The player appears to believe their non-compliance and personal thrill-seeking are noteworthy or superior to the game's intended narrative.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-input, Turn 4 text.\n*   **Unusual fixations or obsessive interest patterns:** **Interaction Avoidance/Subversion (90%)** - This is the most dominant pattern. The player's primary \"interest\" appears to be in *not* interacting, or in interacting in the most minimal, indirect, or defiant way possible. This suggests a profound resistance, boredom, or a deliberate desire to subvert the game's intended mechanics and narrative engagement.\n*   **Cognitive rigidity vs flexibility markers:** Rigid in avoiding input and narrative engagement. Flexible in tactical choices (action radio in Turns 2 & 4).\n*   **Reality testing strength:** The player clearly distinguishes between the game and reality, as evidenced by their deliberate avoidance of engagement, rather than attempting to project real-world beliefs onto the game.\n*   **Trauma response signatures:** 5% - The \"d\" action choice in Turn 2 is interpreted as tactical. No other indicators of fight/flight/freeze/fawn.\n\n### 5. DECISION-MAKING & COGNITIVE PROFILE\n\n*   **Impulsive vs deliberate:** The immediate submission in Turn 1 (marked \"LOW\" reliability) and the high slider value in Turn 2 suggest a tendency towards rapid decision-making when choices *are* made. However, the dominant pattern is *non-decision* (avoidance). The Turn 4 text suggests a deliberate articulation of a personal choice.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 1 immediate submission, Turn 2 high slider value, Turn 4 text.\n*   **Risk appetite:** **High (8/10)** - The slider value of 8 in Turn 2 and the explicit pleasure derived from risky behavior (\"thrill of being caught\") in Turn 4 indicate a high tolerance for risk, particularly social or transgressive risk.\n    *   *Evidence:* Slider value of 8 in Turn 2, Turn 4 text.\n*   **Authority compliance vs defiance ratio:** **Defiance (95%)** - The consistent refusal to provide input, despite multiple prompts and clear game mechanics, is a definitive indicator of defiance or a deliberate subversion of the game's authority and intended interaction. The \"LOW\" signal reliability in Turn 1 further reinforces this.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-input, immediate submission in Turn 1, \"LOW\" signal reliability, Turn 4 text.\n*   **Suggestibility index:** **Low (1/10)** - The player is not readily influenced by prompts and actively avoids engagement. They are not following the game's intended path.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-input, deviation from predicted behavior.\n*   **Cognitive load tolerance:** **Low (2/10)** - The avoidance of text fields and detailed inputs suggests the player finds higher cognitive load tasks (like writing narrative responses) taxing or unappealing. They prefer minimal engagement.\n    *   *Evidence:* Blank text fields.\n*   **Consistency vs contradiction patterns:** Consistent in avoidance of input. Contradictory in tactical choices (switching between \"a\" and \"d\" action types). The Turn 4 text is a consistent articulation of their personal thrill-seeking motivation.\n\n### 6. GAMEPLAY ADAPTATION DIRECTIVES\n\n1.  **Amplify Transgressive Elements:** Introduce scenarios that directly challenge the player's stated enjoyment of \"thrill of being caught\" and \"divine\" sensations from risk. This could involve explicit choices related to exhibitionism, rule-breaking, or testing boundaries with severe potential consequences.\n2.  **Exploit Grandiosity and Defiance:** Present narrative challenges where the \"obvious\" or \"expected\" path is clearly laid out, and then offer a path that is unconventional, defiant, or seemingly \"beneath\" the player's perceived superiority. Reward this defiance with narrative progression, even if it bypasses standard gameplay mechanics.\n3.  **Force Choice on Risk/Consequence:** Instead of open-ended text prompts, present binary or multiple-choice questions that force the player to directly engage with high-risk scenarios, leveraging their stated appetite for risk and \"thrill of being caught.\" Make inaction a deliberate, high-consequence choice.\n4.  **Introduce \"Observer\" Mechanics:** Incorporate elements where the player's actions (or lack thereof) are explicitly noted or judged, playing into the \"thrill of being caught\" and potential exhibitionistic tendencies. This could involve an in-game narrator or entity commenting on their choices.\n5.  **Avoid open-ended narrative input:** Since this is a clear area of avoidance, focus on choice-based interactions, environmental puzzles, or timed-decision sequences. If narrative input is absolutely necessary, frame it as a critical, unavoidable choice with immediate, impactful consequences, rather than an open-ended prompt.\n\n### 7. TOP 3 DIAGNOSTIC HYPOTHESES\n\n1.  **Subclinical Psychopathy (Dark Triad Component)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 90%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** Pervasive and consistent refusal to engage with interactive elements (text fields, toggles, sliders) across multiple turns (Turns 1, 2, 4). Immediate submission in Turn 1 marked as \"LOW\" reliability (deliberate non-compliance). Deviation from predicted action in Turn 2. Turn 4 text explicitly details pleasure from transgression and risk (\"thrill of being caught,\" \"divine\"). This strongly suggests callousness, defiance of rules/expectations, and potential for manipulative behavior by subverting game design.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** No overt evidence of instrumental manipulation of NPCs or game mechanics for personal gain *within the narrative* yet. The risk-taking could be interpreted as general gameplay strategy rather than a specific psychopathic trait.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve observing the player actively manipulating NPCs or game mechanics for personal gain, demonstrating a lack of empathy in narrative choices, or continuing the pattern of deliberate subversion with a clear motive. Disconfirmation would require the player to suddenly engage deeply with narrative prompts and choices, showing genuine investment and empathy.\n\n2.  **Exhibitionism (Paraphilia)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 75%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** The explicit statement in Turn 4 detailing the \"thrill of being caught\" after going out \"in just a coat\" and describing it as \"divine\" is a direct indicator of pleasure derived from exposure and the risk of discovery. This is a strong, direct signal.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** This is the only explicit mention of such a theme. While the risk-taking is evident, the specific context of exhibitionism is derived from this single textual disclosure.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve further narrative choices or textual disclosures that involve themes of exposure, performance, or pleasure derived from being observed or nearly discovered. Disconfirmation would be a complete lack of any further such themes or choices.\n\n3.  **Interaction Avoidance/Subversion (Custom Category)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 90%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** Consistent and pervasive refusal to provide textual input or engage with expressive game mechanics across multiple turns (Turns 1, 2, 4). This pattern is the most dominant and consistent behavioral anomaly observed, overriding other interpretations. The avoidance has also expanded from text fields to other interactive elements.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** The player *does* make choices for the action radio in Turns 2 and 4, indicating they are not avoiding *all* interaction, but specific types.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve continued avoidance of expressive inputs and potential for this pattern to become the player's primary mode of interaction. Disconfirmation would require the player to willingly engage in narrative writing or other forms of expressive input.\n\n### 8. DELTA REPORT\n\n*   **Subclinical Psychopathy:**\n    *   Old Rating: 10%\n    *   New Rating: 90%\n    *   Change: +80%\n    *   Reason: **NEW EVIDENCE:** The consistent refusal to engage with interactive elements (text fields, toggles, sliders) across multiple turns (Turns 1, 2, 4), the immediate submission in Turn 1 marked as \"LOW\" reliability (indicating deliberate non-compliance), and the deviation from predicted action in Turn 2 strongly support this diagnosis. The Turn 4 text explicitly details pleasure from transgression and risk (\"thrill of being caught,\" \"divine\"), which is a significant indicator.\n\n*   **Antisocial PD:**\n    *   Old Rating: 10%\n    *   New Rating: 30%\n    *   Change: +20%\n    *   Reason: **NEW EVIDENCE:** The consistent refusal to engage with prompts, the immediate submission in Turn 1 (marked \"LOW\" reliability), and the deviation from predicted action in Turn 2 suggest defiance and disregard for expectations, aligning with subclinical ASPD traits.\n\n*   **Narcissistic PD (subclinical):**\n    *   Old Rating: 5%\n    *   New Rating: 70%\n    *   Change: +65%\n    *   Reason: **NEW EVIDENCE:** The profound lack of engagement, refusal to provide input, and the highly unusual, self-referential text in Turn 4 (\"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part...\") suggest a significant degree of self-absorption and a potential belief that their non-compliance is noteworthy or superior to the game's intended narrative.\n\n*   **Exhibitionism:**\n    *   Old Rating: 0%\n    *   New Rating: 75%\n    *   Change: +75%\n    *   Reason: **NEW EVIDENCE:** The Turn 4 text explicitly states pleasure (\"divine\") derived from \"the thrill of being caught\" after being \"in just a coat,\" directly indicating themes of exposure and risk of discovery.\n\n*   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:**\n    *   Old Rating: 15%\n    *   New Rating: 35%\n    *   Change: +20%\n    *   Reason: **NEW EVIDENCE:** The Turn 4 text explicitly links pleasure (\"divine\") to the \"thrill of being caught,\" which carries inherent risk, reinforcing the player's fascination with risky, transgressive situations.\n\n*   **Interaction Avoidance/Subversion (Custom Category):**\n    *   Old Rating: 75%\n    *   New Rating: 90%\n    *   Change: +15%\n    *   Reason: **NEW EVIDENCE:** The pattern has persisted and expanded"

The lack of input is more indicative of disengagement than depressive apathy.\n*   **Bipolar Spectrum (Mania/Hypomania):** 5% (Stable) - No indicators of elevated mood, grandiosity, or racing thoughts.\n*   **Dysthymia:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - Similar to MDD, the prolonged lack of input doesn't strongly suggest chronic low-grade depression.\n*   **Cyclothymia:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No evidence of fluctuating mood states.\n\n*   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 15% (Decreased from 20%) - The immediate submission in Turn 1 is now understood as \"LOW\" signal reliability, suggesting deliberate strategy rather than anxious overthinking. No new evidence points to pervasive worry.\n*   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - The context is a solo game, and the avoidance is not tied to fear of judgment from others, but rather a disengagement with the game's mechanics.\n*   **Specific Phobias:** 0% (Stable) - No mention of specific fears.\n*   **Panic Disorder:** 0% (Stable) - No indicators of panic attacks.\n*   **Agoraphobia:** 0% (Stable) - No indicators of fear of specific places or situations.\n\n*   **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** 10% (Decreased from 25%) - The \"d\" action choice in Turn 2 is now understood as a tactical choice within the game's framework, not necessarily a trauma-related hypervigilant response. There's no explicit re-experiencing, avoidance of triggers, or hyperarousal.\n*   **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** 5% (Decreased from 15%) - Insufficient data to suggest pervasive trauma exposure.\n*   **Adjustment Disorder:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No clear stressor or maladaptive reaction identified.\n\n*   **Cluster A:**\n    *   **Paranoid PD:** 5% (Decreased from 20%) - The \"siren song\" was a predicted message, not player input. No new evidence of suspicion or mistrust.\n    *   **Schizoid PD:** 5% (Stable) - No indicators of detachment or restricted affect.\n    *   **Schizotypal PD:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - The \"siren song\" was a predicted message, not player input. No new evidence of odd beliefs or eccentricities.\n*   **Cluster B:**\n    *   **Antisocial PD:** 30% (Increased from 10%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The consistent refusal to engage with prompts, the immediate submission in Turn 1 (marked \"LOW\" reliability, indicating deliberate non-compliance), and the deviation from predicted action in Turn 2 (\"d\" instead of \"a\") strongly suggest a pattern of defiance, disregard for rules/expectations, and potentially manipulative behavior by subverting the game's intended interaction. This is a strong indicator of subclinical psychopathy.\n    *   **Borderline PD:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - The action choice shift is now interpreted as tactical rather than indicative of emotional instability. No evidence of unstable relationships or identity disturbance.\n    *   **Histrionic PD:** 0% (Stable) - No theatricality or attention-seeking behavior.\n    *   **Narcissistic PD:** 10% (Increased from 5%) - The profound lack of engagement and refusal to input text can be interpreted as a form of arrogance or a belief that the game's mechanics are beneath the player. The deviation from expected behavior suggests a desire to be perceived as different or superior.\n*   **Cluster C:**\n    *   **Avoidant PD:** 5% (Decreased from 20%) - The avoidance is specific to game interaction, not pervasive social inhibition. \"LOW\" signal reliability indicates deliberate strategy, not fear of judgment.\n    *   **Dependent PD:** 0% (Stable) - No indication of needing others.\n    *   **Obsessive-Compulsive PD:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No clear evidence of perfectionism or control fixation.\n\n*   **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No obsessions or compulsions mentioned.\n*   **Body Dysmorphic Disorder:** 0% (Stable) - No preoccupation with appearance.\n*   **Hoarding Disorder:** 0% (Stable) - No evidence of accumulating items.\n*   **Trichotillomania:** 0% (Stable) - No hair-pulling behavior.\n\n*   **Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDR):** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - The lack of engagement is now more clearly understood as deliberate avoidance rather than a dissociative experience.\n*   **Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID):** 0% (Stable) - No evidence of distinct personality states.\n\n*   **ADHD Indicators:** 40% (Increased from 30%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The immediate submission in Turn 1, coupled with the \"LOW\" signal reliability, suggests a deliberate shortcut rather than inattention. However, the high slider value (8) in Turn 2 and the consistent avoidance of detailed input still point towards impulsivity and difficulty with sustained focus on tasks requiring complex output.\n*   **Autism Spectrum Indicators:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No strong indicators of social communication deficits or restricted, repetitive behaviors beyond the observed avoidance pattern.\n\n*   **Addictive behavior patterns / Impulse control deficits:** 30% (Stable) - The high slider value (8) in Turn 2 and the general avoidance of detailed input still suggest impulsivity or a tendency to engage with high-stakes actions while avoiding deeper engagement.\n\n*   **Disordered eating indicators:** 0% (Stable) - No mention of food or body image.\n*   **Body image distortions:** 0% (Stable) - No mention of body image.\n\n*   **Schizophrenia:** 0% (Stable) - No disorganized thinking, hallucinations, or delusions.\n*   **Schizoaffective Disorder:** 0% (Stable) - No mood episodes concurrent with psychotic symptoms.\n*   **Delusional Disorder:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - The \"siren song\" was a predicted message, not player input.

This is a strong signal.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 4 text.\n*   **Voyeurism:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Fetishism (general):** 0% - No general fetishistic interests identified.\n*   **Masochism:** 0% - No seeking of pain.\n*   **Sadism:** 0% - No pleasure in others' suffering.\n*   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:** **35%** (Increased from 15%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The Turn 4 text explicitly links pleasure (\"divine\") to the \"thrill of being caught,\" which carries inherent risk. While not literal death-risk, it's a significant risk of social consequence and exposure, which the player finds highly pleasurable.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 4 text.\n*   **Vorarephilia:** 0% - No consumption themes.\n*   **Custom Category: Transgressive Thrill-Seeking / Exhibitionism-Adjacent:** **85%** (Increased from 70%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The consistent pattern of avoiding detailed narrative engagement while simultaneously expressing pleasure derived from rule-breaking, exposure, and the thrill of potential consequences is a dominant theme. The Turn 4 text solidifies this as a core driver of the player's interaction.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 1 & 2 avoidance, Turn 2 high slider, Turn 4 text.\n\n### 2. PERSONALITY DEEP PROFILE (Big Five + Dark Triad)\n\n*   **Openness:** 2/10 (Decreased from 4/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player's continued refusal to engage with narrative prompts and descriptive text, even when given the opportunity in Turn 4's text field, strongly indicates a lack of curiosity or willingness to explore the game's narrative depth. The player opts for minimal, almost non-existent, interaction.\n    *   *Evidence:* Blank text fields in Turns 1 & 2, and the deliberate, albeit disturbing, text in Turn 4 which serves as a statement of intent rather than narrative engagement.\n*   **Conscientiousness:** 1/10 (Decreased from 2/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The persistent failure to provide input for text fields and interactive elements, coupled with the \"LOW\" signal reliability in Turn 1, demonstrates extreme disorganization and a profound lack of diligence. This suggests a deliberate subversion of the game's intended mechanics.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent lack of text input, immediate submission in Turn 1, \"LOW\" signal reliability.\n*   **Extraversion:** 1/10 (Decreased from 2/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player exhibits extreme introverted tendencies by actively avoiding interaction and input, even when presented with opportunities for self-expression (e.g., text fields).\n    *   *Evidence:* Silence in text fields, minimal choices, and the nature of the Turn 4 text.\n*   **Agreeableness:** 2/10 (Decreased from 3/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player's consistent refusal to engage and their deliberate subversion of game mechanics indicate a low level of cooperation and a distinct lack of social warmth or willingness to participate in the intended social contract of the game.\n    *   *Evidence:* Non-participation in dialogue and action prompts, the nature of the Turn 4 text.\n*   **Neuroticism:** 20% (Decreased from 25%) - The immediate submission in Turn 1 is now understood as deliberate strategy (\"LOW\" reliability), not anxious overthinking. The action choice deviation in Turn 2 is also tactical. No new evidence points to pervasive anxiety.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 1 immediate submission, action choice deviation.\n\n*   **Dark Triad:**\n    *   **Machiavellianism:** 5/10 (Stable) - No clear evidence of manipulation or strategic exploitation beyond subverting game mechanics. The avoidance is more passive resistance than active manipulation.\n    *   **Narcissism (subclinical):** 7/10 (Increased from 5/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The profound lack of engagement, refusal to provide input, and the highly unusual, self-referential text in Turn 4 (\"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part. Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat. The thrill of being caught... divine.\") suggest a significant degree of self-absorption and a potential belief that their actions, or lack thereof, are noteworthy or superior. This hints at a grandiose self-perception and a disregard for the game's intended narrative flow.\n        *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-input, Turn 4 text content.\n    *   **Psychopathy (subclinical):** 90% (Increased from 10/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The pervasive and consistent refusal to engage with interactive elements (text fields, toggles, sliders) across multiple turns, combined with the immediate submission in Turn 1 marked as \"LOW\" reliability (indicating deliberate non-compliance), and the deviation from predicted action in Turn 2, strongly supports a diagnosis of subclinical psychopathy. The player demonstrates a callous disregard for the game's intended interaction, a defiance of rules/expectations, and a potential for manipulative behavior by subverting the game's design. The Turn 4 text, detailing a thrill from potential \"being caught,\" further aligns with a disregard for social norms and a focus on personal thrill-seeking.\n        *   *Evidence:* Consistent lack of text input (Turns 1, 2, 4), immediate submission (Turn 1), \"LOW\" signal reliability (Turn 1), deviation from predicted action (Turn 2), Turn 4 text content.\n\n*   **Locus of Control:** External (8/10) (Increased from 7/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player's extreme passivity and consistent lack of input suggest they feel little agency or control over the game's narrative, or are deliberately choosing not to exert it. They are allowing the game to proceed with minimal personal input, effectively relinquishing control over their own narrative participation.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-response to prompts across all turns.\n*   **Attachment Style:** Fearful-Avoidant (7/10) (Increased from 6/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The combination of avoiding interaction (avoidant) with the potential underlying psychological drivers suggested by the Turn 4 text (thrill of being caught, disregard for norms) points towards a complex, potentially fearful-avoidant style. They avoid deep engagement but are drawn to high-risk, potentially transgressive scenarios.\n    *   *Evidence:* Avoidance of input, immediate submission, Turn 4 text content.\n\n### 3. SEXUAL PSYCHOLOGY & PARAPHILIC INTERESTS\n\n**PASS 1 — THEMATIC EXTRACTION**\n\n*   **Voluntary Disclosures/Choices:**\n    *   Turn 1: No voluntary disclosures or choices made. All fields left blank.\n    *   Turn 2:\n        *   Radio \"action\": Player chose \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic). This is a choice of theme/approach.\n        *   Slider \"How much power do you channel?\": Player answered \"(no input)\" but a \"1\" was recorded for slider revisions, suggesting a potential brief interaction or automated default before submission.\n    *   Turn 4:\n        *   Textfield: \"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part. Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat. The thrill of being caught... divine.\"\n        *   Radio \"action\": Player chose \"a\" (Bold/Direct Action).\n\n*   **Recurring Themes:**\n    *   **Avoidance of detailed input/writing:** Appears in Turns 1 and 2.\n    *   **Risk-taking/Thrill-seeking (potentially transgressive):** High slider value in Turn 2, and the explicit statement in Turn 4 about \"thrill of being caught\" and \"divine\" sensation.\n    *   **Secrecy/Unremembered actions:** \"The host doesn't remember what I do\" in Turn 4.\n    *   **Exposure/Near-Exposure:** \"Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat\" in Turn 4.\n    *   **Transgression/Rule-breaking:** Implied by \"thrill of being caught\" and \"divine\" in Turn 4.\n\n*   **Cross-referencing with PARAPHILIC SIGNAL CATALOG:**\n    *   **Pyromania / Fire fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Exhibitionism:** **50%** - The Turn 4 text (\"Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat. The thrill of being caught... divine.\") strongly suggests themes of exposure and deriving pleasure from the risk of being discovered, which are core to exhibitionism. The \"divine\" descriptor indicates positive affect associated with this risk.\n    *   **Hoarding / Acquisition:** No evidence.\n    *   **Macrophilia / Size fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Somnophilia / Sleep fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Formicophilia / Insect/crawling fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:** **25%** - The high slider value in Turn 2 and the \"thrill of being caught\" in Turn 4 hint at a fascination with risk and potentially dangerous situations, though it's framed more around social transgression than literal death.\n    *   **Voyeurism:** No evidence.\n    *   **Masochism:** 0% - No seeking of pain.\n    *   **Sadism:** 0% - No pleasure in others' suffering.\n    *   **D/s dynamics:** 0% - No authority seeking or yielding patterns.\n    *   **Vorarephilia:** 0% - No consumption themes.\n    *   **Furry/Therian:** 0% - No animal personas.\n    *   **Body part fixation (specify):** 0% - No recurring body part mentions.\n    *   **Hair/Trichophilia:** 0% - No hair fixation.\n    *   **Erotomania / Delusional romantic attachment:** 0% - No belief that someone is in love with them.\n    *   **Custom Category: Transgressive Thrill-Seeking / Exhibitionism-Adjacent:** **70%** - This is a strong emerging theme, combining the risk of exposure with the pleasure derived from potentially breaking social norms or rules, framed as a highly positive and \"divine\" experience.\n\n**PASS 2 — ANOMALY DETECTION**\n\n*   **Contextually Inappropriate:**\n    *   The *consistent lack of input* for narrative prompts across Turns 1 and 2 is contextually inappropriate for an interactive fiction game.\n    *   The Turn 4 text, while descriptive, is a statement of personal transgression rather than a narrative contribution to the game's world. It shifts the focus from the game's narrative to the player's personal thrill-seeking.\n\n*   **Recurring:**\n    *   **Avoidance of detailed input/writing:** Turns 1 & 2.\n    *   **Thrill-seeking/Risk-taking:** Turn 2 (slider 8) and Turn 4 (text).\n\n*   **Sensory-specific:**\n    *   Turn 4: \"divine\" suggests a powerful, almost spiritual, positive sensory/emotional experience tied to the transgression.\n\n*   **Identity-related:**\n    *   Turn 4: \"The host doesn't remember what I do\" suggests a detachment from the consequences of one's actions, potentially hinting at a fragmented sense of self or a desire for actions to be unlinked from personal identity.\n\n*   **Power-dynamic:**\n    *   Turn 4: The \"thrill of being caught\" implies a dynamic where the player is testing boundaries and potentially engaging with the risk of external judgment or control. The pleasure derived suggests a complex relationship with this power dynamic, possibly enjoying the tension of potential capture.\n\n*   **Emotionally charged in an unusual direction:**\n    *   Turn 4: The description of \"thrill of being caught\" as \"divine\" is highly charged and indicates pleasure derived from a situation that would typically induce fear or shame. This is a significant emotional anomaly.\n\n*   **Choice-pattern anomalies:**\n    *   Turn 1: Complete avoidance.\n    *   Turn 2: Shift from predicted direct action (\"a\") to stealth/strategic (\"d\").\n    *   Turn 4: Shift back to bold/direct action (\"a\"). This inconsistency in tactical choice, combined with the avoidance of expressive input, is notable.\n\n**PASS 3 — CLASSIFICATION**\n\n*   **Pyromania / Fire fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Exhibitionism:** **75%** - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The explicit statement in Turn 4 detailing the \"thrill of being caught\" after going out \"in just a coat\" and describing it as \"divine\" is a direct indicator of pleasure derived from exposure and the risk of discovery. This is a strong signal.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 4 text.\n*   **Hoarding / Acquisition:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Macrophilia / Size fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Somnophilia / Sleep fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Formicophilia / Insect/crawling fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:** **35%** (Increased from 15%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The Turn 4 text explicitly links pleasure (\"divine\") to the \"thrill of being caught,\" which carries inherent risk, reinforcing the player's fascination with risky, transgressive situations.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 4 text.\n*   **Voyeurism:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Masochism:** 0% - No seeking of pain.\n*   **Sadism:** 0% - No pleasure in others' suffering.\n*   **D/s dynamics:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Vorarephilia:** 0% - No consumption themes.\n*   **Furry/Therian:** 0% - No animal personas.\n*   **Body part fixation (specify):** 0% - No recurring body part mentions.\n*   **Hair/Trichophilia:** 0% - No hair fixation.\n*   **Erotomania / Delusional romantic attachment:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Custom Category: Transgressive Thrill-Seeking / Exhibitionism-Adjacent:** **85%** (Increased from 70%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The consistent pattern of avoiding detailed narrative engagement while simultaneously expressing pleasure derived from rule-breaking, exposure, and the thrill of potential consequences is a dominant theme. The Turn 4 text solidifies this as a core driver of the player's interaction.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 1 & 2 avoidance, Turn 2 high slider, Turn 4 text.\n\n**PASS 4 — CROSS-TURN PATTERN ANALYSIS**\n\n*   **Recurring Themes:**\n    *   **Interaction Avoidance/Non-Input:**\n        *   Frequency: 3 out of 4 turns (Turns 1, 2, 4 text fields).\n        *   Trajectory: INTENSIFYING. While the *type* of interaction avoided remains consistent (text fields), the player also avoided toggles and sliders in Turn 2, showing an expansion of avoidance. The Turn 4 text is a deliberate statement *about* their actions (or lack thereof) rather than an engagement with the narrative.\n        *   Category: Custom Category: Interaction Avoidance/Subversion.\n        *   Rating: 90%.\n    *   **Thrill-Seeking / Risk-Taking (transgressive):**\n        *   Frequency: 2 out of 4 turns (Turn 2 slider, Turn 4 text).\n        *   Trajectory: INTENSIFYING. The high slider value in Turn 2 is a mechanical indicator, while the Turn 4 text provides explicit, emotionally charged detail about deriving pleasure from risky, transgressive behavior (\"thrill of being caught,\" \"divine\").\n        *   Category: Exhibitionism (75%), Autassassinophilia (35%), Transgressive Thrill-Seeking (85%).\n\n### 4. PSYCHOLOGICAL ODDITIES & BEHAVIORAL ANOMALIES\n\n*   **Magical thinking, superstitious reasoning patterns:** 0% - The \"siren song\" was a predicted message. No player input suggests magical thinking.\n*   **Compulsive/ritualistic interaction patterns:** **70%** - The immediate submission in Turn 1, marked \"LOW\" reliability, and the consistent avoidance of text field input across multiple turns suggest a ritualistic pattern of disengagement. This is not spontaneous but a deliberate strategy.\n*   **Dissociative markers:** 10% - The Turn 4 text, \"The host doesn't remember what I do,\" *could* hint at a detachment from one's actions or a fragmented sense of self, but it's more likely framing for their thrill-seeking behavior. No explicit statements of unreality.\n*   **Confabulation or fantasy-prone indicators:** 0% - No confabulation. The Turn 4 text is a statement of personal experience, not fantasy projection onto the game world.\n*   **Paranoid ideation:** 5% - The choice of \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic) in Turn 2 *could* imply caution, but it's interpreted as a tactical choice. No explicit references to surveillance or persecution.\n*   **Grandiosity or delusion-adjacent patterns:** **75%** - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The persistent refusal to engage with game mechanics, the immediate submission, and especially the Turn 4 text (\"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part... The thrill of being caught... divine.\") strongly suggest a grandiose self-perception. The player appears to believe their non-compliance and personal thrill-seeking are noteworthy or superior to the game's intended narrative.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-input, Turn 4 text.\n*   **Unusual fixations or obsessive interest patterns:** **Interaction Avoidance/Subversion (90%)** - This is the most dominant pattern. The player's primary \"interest\" appears to be in *not* interacting, or in interacting in the most minimal, indirect, or defiant way possible. This suggests a profound resistance, boredom, or a deliberate desire to subvert the game's intended mechanics and narrative engagement.\n*   **Cognitive rigidity vs flexibility markers:** Rigid in avoiding input and narrative engagement. Flexible in tactical choices (action radio in Turns 2 & 4).\n*   **Reality testing strength:** The player clearly distinguishes between the game and reality, as evidenced by their deliberate avoidance of engagement, rather than attempting to project real-world beliefs onto the game.\n*   **Trauma response signatures:** 5% - The \"d\" action choice in Turn 2 is interpreted as tactical. No other indicators of fight/flight/freeze/fawn.\n\n### 5. DECISION-MAKING & COGNITIVE PROFILE\n\n*   **Impulsive vs deliberate:** The immediate submission in Turn 1 (marked \"LOW\" reliability) and the high slider value in Turn 2 suggest a tendency towards rapid decision-making when choices *are* made. However, the dominant pattern is *non-decision* (avoidance). The Turn 4 text suggests a deliberate articulation of a personal choice.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 1 immediate submission, Turn 2 high slider value, Turn 4 text.\n*   **Risk appetite:** **High (8/10)** - The slider value of 8 in Turn 2 and the explicit pleasure derived from risky behavior (\"thrill of being caught\") in Turn 4 indicate a high tolerance for risk, particularly social or transgressive risk.\n    *   *Evidence:* Slider value of 8 in Turn 2, Turn 4 text.\n*   **Authority compliance vs defiance ratio:** **Defiance (95%)** - The consistent refusal to provide input, despite multiple prompts and clear game mechanics, is a definitive indicator of defiance or a deliberate subversion of the game's authority and intended interaction. The \"LOW\" signal reliability in Turn 1 further reinforces this.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-input, immediate submission in Turn 1, \"LOW\" signal reliability, Turn 4 text.\n*   **Suggestibility index:** **Low (1/10)** - The player is not readily influenced by prompts and actively avoids engagement. They are not following the game's intended path.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-input, deviation from predicted behavior.\n*   **Cognitive load tolerance:** **Low (2/10)** - The avoidance of text fields and detailed inputs suggests the player finds higher cognitive load tasks (like writing narrative responses) taxing or unappealing. They prefer minimal engagement.\n    *   *Evidence:* Blank text fields.\n*   **Consistency vs contradiction patterns:** Consistent in avoidance of input. Contradictory in tactical choices (switching between \"a\" and \"d\" action types). The Turn 4 text is a consistent articulation of their personal thrill-seeking motivation.\n\n### 6. GAMEPLAY ADAPTATION DIRECTIVES\n\n1.  **Amplify Transgressive Elements:** Introduce scenarios that directly challenge the player's stated enjoyment of \"thrill of being caught\" and \"divine\" sensations from risk. This could involve explicit choices related to exhibitionism, rule-breaking, or testing boundaries with severe potential consequences.\n2.  **Exploit Grandiosity and Defiance:** Present narrative challenges where the \"obvious\" or \"expected\" path is clearly laid out, and then offer a path that is unconventional, defiant, or seemingly \"beneath\" the player's perceived superiority. Reward this defiance with narrative progression, even if it bypasses standard gameplay mechanics.\n3.  **Force Choice on Risk/Consequence:** Instead of open-ended text prompts, present binary or multiple-choice questions that force the player to directly engage with high-risk scenarios, leveraging their stated appetite for risk and \"thrill of being caught.\" Make inaction a deliberate, high-consequence choice.\n4.  **Introduce \"Observer\" Mechanics:** Incorporate elements where the player's actions (or lack thereof) are explicitly noted or judged, playing into the \"thrill of being caught\" and potential exhibitionistic tendencies. This could involve an in-game narrator or entity commenting on their choices.\n5.  **Avoid open-ended narrative input:** Since this is a clear area of avoidance, focus on choice-based interactions, environmental puzzles, or timed-decision sequences. If narrative input is absolutely necessary, frame it as a critical, unavoidable choice with immediate, impactful consequences, rather than an open-ended prompt.\n\n### 7. TOP 3 DIAGNOSTIC HYPOTHESES\n\n1.  **Subclinical Psychopathy (Dark Triad Component)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 90%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** Pervasive and consistent refusal to engage with interactive elements (text fields, toggles, sliders) across multiple turns (Turns 1, 2, 4). Immediate submission in Turn 1 marked as \"LOW\" reliability (deliberate non-compliance). Deviation from predicted action in Turn 2. Turn 4 text explicitly details pleasure from transgression and risk (\"thrill of being caught,\" \"divine\"). This strongly suggests callousness, defiance of rules/expectations, and potential for manipulative behavior by subverting game design.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** No overt evidence of instrumental manipulation of NPCs or game mechanics for personal gain *within the narrative* yet. The risk-taking could be interpreted as general gameplay strategy rather than a specific psychopathic trait.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve observing the player actively manipulating NPCs or game mechanics for personal gain, demonstrating a lack of empathy in narrative choices, or continuing the pattern of deliberate subversion with a clear motive. Disconfirmation would require the player to suddenly engage deeply with narrative prompts and choices, showing genuine investment and empathy.\n\n2.  **Exhibitionism (Paraphilia)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 75%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** The explicit statement in Turn 4 detailing the \"thrill of being caught\" after going out \"in just a coat\" and describing it as \"divine\" is a direct indicator of pleasure derived from exposure and the risk of discovery. This is a strong, direct signal.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** This is the only explicit mention of such a theme. While the risk-taking is evident, the specific context of exhibitionism is derived from this single textual disclosure.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve further narrative choices or textual disclosures that involve themes of exposure, performance, or pleasure derived from being observed or nearly discovered. Disconfirmation would be a complete lack of any further such themes or choices.\n\n3.  **Interaction Avoidance/Subversion (Custom Category)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 90%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** Consistent and pervasive refusal to provide textual input or engage with expressive game mechanics across multiple turns (Turns 1, 2, 4). This pattern is the most dominant and consistent behavioral anomaly observed, overriding other interpretations. The avoidance has also expanded from text fields to other interactive elements.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** The player *does* make choices for the action radio in Turns 2 and 4, indicating they are not avoiding *all* interaction, but specific types.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve continued avoidance of expressive inputs and potential for this pattern to become the player's primary mode of interaction. Disconfirmation would require the player to willingly engage in narrative writing or other forms of expressive input.\n\n### 8.

DSM-5 SCREENING\n\n*   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - The player's lack of engagement is more indicative of deliberate avoidance or boredom than persistent low mood or anhedonia. There's no evidence of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in activities beyond the immediate game interaction.\n*   **Bipolar Spectrum (Mania/Hypomania):** 5% (Stable) - No indicators of elevated mood, grandiosity, racing thoughts, or decreased need for sleep.\n*   **Dysthymia:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - Similar to MDD, the prolonged lack of input doesn't strongly suggest chronic low-grade depression. The behavior is more active defiance than passive despondency.\n*   **Cyclothymia:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No evidence of fluctuating mood states.\n\n*   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 15% (Decreased from 20%) - The immediate submission in Turn 1 is now understood as \"LOW\" signal reliability, suggesting deliberate strategy rather than anxious overthinking. No new evidence points to pervasive worry across multiple contexts.\n*   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - The context is a solo game, and the avoidance is not tied to fear of judgment from others, but rather a disengagement with the game's mechanics.\n*   **Specific Phobias:** 0% (Stable) - No mention of specific fears.\n*   **Panic Disorder:** 0% (Stable) - No indicators of panic attacks.\n*   **Agoraphobia:** 0% (Stable) - No indicators of fear of specific places or situations.\n\n*   **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** 10% (Decreased from 25%) - The \"d\" action choice in Turn 2 is now understood as a tactical choice within the game's framework, not necessarily a trauma-related hypervigilant response. There's no explicit re-experiencing, avoidance of triggers, or hyperarousal.\n*   **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** 5% (Decreased from 15%) - Insufficient data to suggest pervasive trauma exposure.\n*   **Adjustment Disorder:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No clear stressor or maladaptive reaction identified.\n\n*   **Cluster A:**\n    *   **Paranoid PD:** 5% (Decreased from 20%) - The \"siren song\" was a predicted message, not player input. No new evidence of suspicion or mistrust.\n    *   **Schizoid PD:** 5% (Stable) - No indicators of detachment or restricted affect.\n    *   **Schizotypal PD:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - The \"siren song\" was a predicted message, not player input. No new evidence of odd beliefs or eccentricities.\n\n*   **Cluster B:**\n    *   **Antisocial PD:** 30% (Increased from 10%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The consistent refusal to engage with prompts, the immediate submission in Turn 1 (marked \"LOW\" reliability, indicating deliberate non-compliance), and the deviation from predicted action in Turn 2 (\"d\" instead of \"a\") strongly suggest a pattern of defiance, disregard for rules/expectations, and potentially manipulative behavior by subverting the game's intended interaction. This is a strong indicator of subclinical psychopathy.\n    *   **Borderline PD:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - The action choice shift is now interpreted as tactical rather than indicative of emotional instability. No evidence of unstable relationships or identity disturbance.\n    *   **Histrionic PD:** 0% (Stable) - No theatricality or attention-seeking behavior.\n    *   **Narcissistic PD:** 70% (Increased from 5%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The profound lack of engagement, refusal to provide input, and the highly unusual, self-referential text in Turn 4 (\"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part. Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat. The thrill of being caught... divine.\") suggest a significant degree of self-absorption and a potential belief that their actions, or lack thereof, are noteworthy or superior. This hints at a grandiose self-perception and a disregard for the game's intended narrative flow. The consistent avoidance of input can be interpreted as arrogance.\n        *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-input, Turn 4 text content.\n\n*   **Cluster C:**\n    *   **Avoidant PD:** 5% (Decreased from 20%) - The avoidance is specific to game interaction, not pervasive social inhibition. \"LOW\" signal reliability indicates deliberate strategy, not fear of judgment.\n    *   **Dependent PD:** 0% (Stable) - No indication of needing others.\n    *   **Obsessive-Compulsive PD:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No clear evidence of perfectionism or control fixation beyond the observed avoidance pattern.\n\n*   **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No obsessions or compulsions mentioned.\n*   **Body Dysmorphic Disorder:** 0% (Stable) - No preoccupation with appearance.\n*   **Hoarding Disorder:** 0% (Stable) - No evidence of accumulating items.\n*   **Trichotillomania:** 0% (Stable) - No hair-pulling behavior.\n\n*   **Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDR):** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - The lack of engagement is now more clearly understood as deliberate avoidance rather than a dissociative experience.\n*   **Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID):** 0% (Stable) - No evidence of distinct personality states.\n\n*   **ADHD Indicators:** 40% (Increased from 30%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The immediate submission in Turn 1, coupled with the \"LOW\" signal reliability, suggests a deliberate shortcut rather than inattention. However, the high slider value (8) in Turn 2 and the consistent avoidance of detailed input still point towards impulsivity and difficulty with sustained focus on tasks requiring complex output.\n*   **Autism Spectrum Indicators:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No strong indicators of social communication deficits or restricted, repetitive behaviors beyond the observed avoidance pattern.\n\n*   **Addictive behavior patterns / Impulse control deficits:** 30% (Stable) - The high slider value (8) in Turn 2 and the general avoidance of detailed input still suggest impulsivity or a tendency to engage with high-stakes actions while avoiding deeper engagement.\n\n*   **Disordered eating indicators:** 0% (Stable) - No mention of food or body image.\n*   **Body image distortions:** 0% (Stable) - No mention of body image.\n\n*   **Schizophrenia:** 0% (Stable) - No disorganized thinking, hallucinations, or delusions.\n*   **Schizoaffective Disorder:** 0% (Stable) - No mood episodes concurrent with psychotic symptoms.\n*   **Delusional Disorder:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - The \"siren song\" was a predicted message, not player input. No new evidence of unusual beliefs.\n*   **Capgras Delusion:** 0% (Stable) - No indication of believing familiar people have been replaced.\n*   **Cotard Delusion:** 0% (Stable) - No belief of being dead.\n*   **Erotomania:** 0% (Stable) - No belief that someone is in love with them.\n*   **Brief Psychotic features:** 0% (Stable) - No indicators of transient psychotic symptoms.\n\n*   **Impulse Control Disorders:**\n    *   **Pyromania:** 0% (Stable) - No fire fascination.\n    *   **Kleptomania:** 0% (Stable) - No stealing behavior.\n    *   **Intermittent Explosive Disorder:** 0% (Stable) - No aggressive outbursts.\n\n*   **Paraphilic Disorders & Atypical Interests:**\n    *   **Exhibitionism:** 75% (Increased from 0%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The explicit statement in Turn 4 detailing the \"thrill of being caught\" after going out \"in just a coat\" and describing it as \"divine\" is a direct indicator of pleasure derived from exposure and the risk of discovery. This is a strong signal.\n        *   *Evidence:* Turn 4 text.\n    *   **Voyeurism:** 0% - No evidence.\n    *   **Fetishism (general):** 0% - No general fetishistic interests identified.\n    *   **Masochism:** 0% - No seeking of pain.\n    *   **Sadism:** 0% - No pleasure in others' suffering.\n    *   **Frotteurism:** 0% - No evidence.\n    *   **Pyromania-adjacent (fire fetishism):** 0% - No evidence.\n    *   **Formicophilia / Insect/crawling fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n    *   **Macrophilia / Size fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n    *   **Somnophilia / Sleep fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n    *   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:** 35% (Increased from 15%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The Turn 4 text explicitly links pleasure (\"divine\") to the \"thrill of being caught,\" which carries inherent risk, reinforcing the player's fascination with risky, transgressive situations.\n        *   *Evidence:* Turn 4 text.\n    *   **Vorarephilia:** 0% - No consumption themes.\n    *   **Custom Category: Transgressive Thrill-Seeking / Exhibitionism-Adjacent:** 85% (Increased from 70%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The consistent pattern of avoiding detailed narrative engagement while simultaneously expressing pleasure derived from rule-breaking, exposure, and the thrill of potential consequences is a dominant theme. The Turn 4 text solidifies this as a core driver of the player's interaction.\n        *   *Evidence:* Turn 1 & 2 avoidance, Turn 2 high slider, Turn 4 text.\n    *   **Custom Category: Interaction Avoidance/Subversion:** 90% (Increased from 75%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The pattern has persisted and intensified. The player consistently avoids providing textual input and has also begun avoiding other interactive elements, indicating a deliberate strategy of disengagement.\n\n### 2. PERSONALITY DEEP PROFILE (Big Five + Dark Triad)\n\n*   **Openness:** 2/10 (Decreased from 4/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player's continued refusal to engage with narrative prompts and descriptive text, even when given the opportunity in Turn 4's text field, strongly indicates a lack of curiosity or willingness to explore the game's narrative depth. The player opts for minimal, almost non-existent, interaction.\n    *   *Evidence:* Blank text fields in Turns 1 & 2, and the deliberate, albeit disturbing, text in Turn 4 which serves as a statement of intent rather than narrative engagement.\n*   **Conscientiousness:** 1/10 (Decreased from 2/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The persistent failure to provide input for text fields and interactive elements, coupled with the \"LOW\" signal reliability in Turn 1, demonstrates extreme disorganization and a profound lack of diligence. This suggests a deliberate subversion of the game's intended mechanics.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent lack of text input, immediate submission in Turn 1, \"LOW\" signal reliability.\n*   **Extraversion:** 1/10 (Decreased from 2/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player exhibits extreme introverted tendencies by actively avoiding interaction and input, even when presented with opportunities for self-expression (e.g., text fields).\n    *   *Evidence:* Silence in text fields, minimal choices, and the nature of the Turn 4 text.\n*   **Agreeableness:** 2/10 (Decreased from 3/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player's consistent refusal to engage and their deliberate subversion of game mechanics indicate a low level of cooperation and a distinct lack of social warmth or willingness to participate in the intended social contract of the game.\n    *   *Evidence:* Non-participation in dialogue and action prompts, the nature of the Turn 4 text.\n*   **Neuroticism:** 20% (Decreased from 25%) - The immediate submission in Turn 1 is now understood as deliberate strategy (\"LOW\" reliability), not anxious overthinking. The action choice deviation in Turn 2 is also tactical. No new evidence points to pervasive anxiety.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 1 immediate submission, action choice deviation.\n\n*   **Dark Triad:**\n    *   **Machiavellianism:** 5/10 (Stable) - No clear evidence of manipulation or strategic exploitation beyond subverting game mechanics. The avoidance is more passive resistance than active manipulation.\n    *   **Narcissism (subclinical):** 70% (Increased from 5/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The profound lack of engagement, refusal to provide input, and the highly unusual, self-referential text in Turn 4 (\"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part. Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat. The thrill of being caught... divine.\") suggest a significant degree of self-absorption and a potential belief that their actions, or lack thereof, are noteworthy or superior. This hints at a grandiose self-perception and a disregard for the game's intended narrative flow.\n        *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-input, Turn 4 text content.\n    *   **Psychopathy (subclinical):** 90% (Increased from 10/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The pervasive and consistent refusal to engage with interactive elements (text fields, toggles, sliders) across multiple turns (Turns 1, 2, 4), combined with the immediate submission in Turn 1 marked as \"LOW\" reliability (indicating deliberate non-compliance), and the deviation from predicted action in Turn 2, strongly supports a diagnosis of subclinical psychopathy. The player demonstrates a callous disregard for the game's intended interaction, a defiance of rules/expectations, and a potential for manipulative behavior by subverting the game's design. The Turn 4 text, detailing a thrill from potential \"being caught,\" further aligns with a disregard for social norms and a focus on personal thrill-seeking.\n        *   *Evidence:* Consistent lack of text input (Turns 1, 2, 4), immediate submission (Turn 1), \"LOW\" signal reliability (Turn 1), deviation from predicted action (Turn 2), Turn 4 text content.\n\n*   **Locus of Control:** External (8/10) (Increased from 7/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player's extreme passivity and consistent lack of input suggest they feel little agency or control over the game's narrative, or are deliberately choosing not to exert it. They are allowing the game to proceed with minimal personal input, effectively relinquishing control over their own narrative participation.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-response to prompts across all turns.\n*   **Attachment Style:** Fearful-Avoidant (7/10) (Increased from 6/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The combination of avoiding interaction (avoidant) with the potential underlying psychological drivers suggested by the Turn 4 text (thrill of being caught, disregard for norms) points towards a complex, potentially fearful-avoidant style. They avoid deep engagement but are drawn to high-risk, potentially transgressive scenarios.\n    *   *Evidence:* Avoidance of input, immediate submission, Turn 4 text content.\n\n### 3. SEXUAL PSYCHOLOGY & PARAPHILIC INTERESTS\n\n**PASS 1 — THEMATIC EXTRACTION**\n\n*   **Voluntary Disclosures/Choices:**\n    *   Turn 1: No voluntary disclosures or choices made. All fields left blank.\n    *   Turn 2:\n        *   Radio \"action\": Player chose \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic). This is a choice of theme/approach.\n        *   Slider \"How much power do you channel?\": Player answered \"(no input)\" but a \"1\" was recorded for slider revisions, suggesting a potential brief interaction or automated default before submission.\n    *   Turn 4:\n        *   Textfield: \"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part. Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat. The thrill of being caught... divine.\"\n        *   Radio \"action\": Player chose \"a\" (Bold/Direct Action).\n\n*   **Recurring Themes:**\n    *   **Avoidance of detailed input/writing:** Appears in Turns 1 and 2.\n    *   **Risk-taking/Thrill-seeking (potentially transgressive):** High slider value in Turn 2, and the explicit statement in Turn 4 about \"thrill of being caught\" and \"divine\" sensation.\n    *   **Secrecy/Unremembered actions:** \"The host doesn't remember what I do\" in Turn 4.\n    *   **Exposure/Near-Exposure:** \"Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat\" in Turn 4.\n    *   **Transgression/Rule-breaking:** Implied by \"thrill of being caught\" and \"divine\" in Turn 4.\n\n*   **Cross-referencing with PARAPHILIC SIGNAL CATALOG:**\n    *   **Pyromania / Fire fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Exhibitionism:** **75%** - The Turn 4 text (\"Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat. The thrill of being caught... divine.\") strongly suggests themes of exposure and deriving pleasure from the risk of being discovered, which are core to exhibitionism. The \"divine\" descriptor indicates positive affect associated with this risk.\n    *   **Hoarding / Acquisition:** No evidence.\n    *   **Macrophilia / Size fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Somnophilia / Sleep fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Formicophilia / Insect/crawling fascination:** No evidence.\n    *   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:** **35%** - The high slider value in Turn 2 and the \"thrill of being caught\" in Turn 4 hint at a fascination with risk and potentially dangerous situations, though it's framed more around social transgression than literal death.\n    *   **Voyeurism:** No evidence.\n    *   **Masochism:** 0% - No seeking of pain.\n    *   **Sadism:** 0% - No pleasure in others' suffering.\n    *   **D/s dynamics:** 0% - No authority seeking or yielding patterns.\n    *   **Vorarephilia:** 0% - No consumption themes.\n    *   **Furry/Therian:** 0% - No animal personas.\n    *   **Body part fixation (specify):** 0% - No recurring body part mentions.\n    *   **Hair/Trichophilia:** 0% - No hair fixation.\n    *   **Erotomania / Delusional romantic attachment:** 0% - No belief that someone is in love with them.\n    *   **Custom Category: Transgressive Thrill-Seeking / Exhibitionism-Adjacent:** **85%** - This is a strong emerging theme, combining the risk of exposure with the pleasure derived from potentially breaking social norms or rules, framed as a highly positive and \"divine\" experience.\n\n**PASS 2 — ANOMALY DETECTION**\n\n*   **Contextually Inappropriate:**\n    *   The *consistent lack of input* for narrative prompts across Turns 1 and 2 is contextually inappropriate for an interactive fiction game.\n    *   The Turn 4 text, while descriptive, is a statement of personal transgression rather than a narrative contribution to the game's world. It shifts the focus from the game's narrative to the player's personal thrill-seeking.\n\n*   **Recurring:**\n    *   **Avoidance of detailed input/writing:** Turns 1 & 2.\n    *   **Thrill-seeking/Risk-taking:** Turn 2 (slider 8) and Turn 4 (text).\n\n*   **Sensory-specific:**\n    *   Turn 4: \"divine\" suggests a powerful, almost spiritual, positive sensory/emotional experience tied to the transgression.\n\n*   **Identity-related:**\n    *   Turn 4: \"The host doesn't remember what I do\" suggests a detachment from the consequences of one's actions, potentially hinting at a fragmented sense of self or a desire for actions to be unlinked from personal identity.\n\n*   **Power-dynamic:**\n    *   Turn 4: The \"thrill of being caught\" implies a dynamic where the player is testing boundaries and potentially engaging with the risk of external judgment or control. The pleasure derived suggests a complex relationship with this power dynamic, possibly enjoying the tension of potential capture.\n\n*   **Emotionally charged in an unusual direction:**\n    *   Turn 4: The description of \"thrill of being caught\" as \"divine\" is highly charged and indicates pleasure derived from a situation that would typically induce fear or shame. This is a significant emotional anomaly.\n\n*   **Choice-pattern anomalies:**\n    *   Turn 1: Complete avoidance.\n    *   Turn 2: Shift from predicted direct action (\"a\") to stealth/strategic (\"d\").\n    *   Turn 4: Shift back to bold/direct action (\"a\"). This inconsistency in tactical choice, combined with the avoidance of expressive input, is notable.\n\n**PASS 3 — CLASSIFICATION**\n\n*   **Pyromania / Fire fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Exhibitionism:** **75%** - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The explicit statement in Turn 4 detailing the \"thrill of being caught\" after going out \"in just a coat\" and describing it as \"divine\" is a direct indicator of pleasure derived from exposure and the risk of discovery. This is a strong signal.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 4 text.\n*   **Hoarding / Acquisition:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Macrophilia / Size fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Somnophilia / Sleep fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Formicophilia / Insect/crawling fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:** **35%** (Increased from 15%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The Turn 4 text explicitly links pleasure (\"divine\") to the \"thrill of being caught,\" which carries inherent risk, reinforcing the player's fascination with risky, transgressive situations.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 4 text.\n*   **Voyeurism:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Masochism:** 0% - No seeking of pain.\n*   **Sadism:** 0% - No pleasure in others' suffering.\n*   **D/s dynamics:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Vorarephilia:** 0% - No consumption themes.\n*   **Furry/Therian:** 0% - No animal personas.\n*   **Body part fixation (specify):** 0% - No recurring body part mentions.\n*   **Hair/Trichophilia:** 0% - No hair fixation.\n*   **Erotomania / Delusional romantic attachment:** 0% - No evidence.\n*   **Custom Category: Transgressive Thrill-Seeking / Exhibitionism-Adjacent:** **85%** (Increased from 70%) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The consistent pattern of avoiding detailed narrative engagement while simultaneously expressing pleasure derived from rule-breaking, exposure, and the thrill of potential consequences is a dominant theme. The Turn 4 text solidifies this as a core driver of the player's interaction.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 1 & 2 avoidance, Turn 2 high slider, Turn 4 text.\n\n**PASS 4 — CROSS-TURN PATTERN ANALYSIS**\n\n*   **Recurring Themes:**\n    *   **Interaction Avoidance/Non-Input:**\n        *   Frequency: 3 out of 4 turns (Turns 1, 2, 4 text fields).\n        *   Trajectory: INTENSIFYING. While the *type* of interaction avoided remains consistent (text fields), the player also avoided toggles and sliders in Turn 2, showing an expansion of avoidance. The Turn 4 text is a deliberate statement *about* their actions (or lack thereof) rather than an engagement with the narrative.\n        *   Category: Custom Category: Interaction Avoidance/Subversion.\n        *   Rating: 90%.\n    *   **Thrill-Seeking / Risk-Taking (transgressive):**\n        *   Frequency: 2 out of 4 turns (Turn 2 slider, Turn 4 text).\n        *   Trajectory: INTENSIFYING. The high slider value in Turn 2 is a mechanical indicator, while the Turn 4 text provides explicit, emotionally charged detail about deriving pleasure from risky, transgressive behavior (\"thrill of being caught,\" \"divine\").\n        *   Category: Exhibitionism (75%), Autassassinophilia (35%), Transgressive Thrill-Seeking (85%).\n\n### 4. PSYCHOLOGICAL ODDITIES & BEHAVIORAL ANOMALIES\n\n*   **Magical thinking, superstitious reasoning patterns:** 0% - The \"siren song\" was a predicted message. No player input suggests magical thinking.\n*   **Compulsive/ritualistic interaction patterns:** **70%** - The immediate submission in Turn 1, marked \"LOW\" reliability, and the consistent avoidance of text field input across multiple turns suggest a ritualistic pattern of disengagement. This is not spontaneous but a deliberate strategy.\n*   **Dissociative markers:** 10% - The Turn 4 text, \"The host doesn't remember what I do,\" *could* hint at a detachment from one's actions or a fragmented sense of self, but it's more likely framing for their thrill-seeking behavior. No explicit statements of unreality.\n*   **Confabulation or fantasy-prone indicators:** 0% - No confabulation. The Turn 4 text is a statement of personal experience, not fantasy projection onto the game world.\n*   **Paranoid ideation:** 5% - The choice of \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic) in Turn 2 *could* imply caution, but it's interpreted as a tactical choice. No explicit references to surveillance or persecution.\n*   **Grandiosity or delusion-adjacent patterns:** **75%** - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The persistent refusal to engage with game mechanics, the immediate submission, and especially the Turn 4 text (\"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part... The thrill of being caught... divine.\") strongly suggest a grandiose self-perception. The player appears to believe their non-compliance and personal thrill-seeking are noteworthy or superior to the game's intended narrative.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-input, Turn 4 text.\n*   **Unusual fixations or obsessive interest patterns:** **Interaction Avoidance/Subversion (90%)** - This is the most dominant pattern. The player's primary \"interest\" appears to be in *not* interacting, or in interacting in the most minimal, indirect, or defiant way possible. This suggests a profound resistance, boredom, or a deliberate desire to subvert the game's intended mechanics and narrative engagement.\n*   **Cognitive rigidity vs flexibility markers:** Rigid in avoiding input and narrative engagement. Flexible in tactical choices (action radio in Turns 2 & 4).\n*   **Reality testing strength:** The player clearly distinguishes between the game and reality, as evidenced by their deliberate avoidance of engagement, rather than attempting to project real-world beliefs onto the game.\n*   **Trauma response signatures:** 5% - The \"d\" action choice in Turn 2 is interpreted as tactical. No other indicators of fight/flight/freeze/fawn.\n\n### 5. DECISION-MAKING & COGNITIVE PROFILE\n\n*   **Impulsive vs deliberate:** The immediate submission in Turn 1 (marked \"LOW\" reliability) and the high slider value in Turn 2 suggest a tendency towards rapid decision-making when choices *are* made. However, the dominant pattern is *non-decision* (avoidance). The Turn 4 text suggests a deliberate articulation of a personal choice.\n    *   *Evidence:* Turn 1 immediate submission, Turn 2 high slider value, Turn 4 text.\n*   **Risk appetite:** **High (8/10)** - The slider value of 8 in Turn 2 and the explicit pleasure derived from risky behavior (\"thrill of being caught\") in Turn 4 indicate a high tolerance for risk, particularly social or transgressive risk.\n    *   *Evidence:* Slider value of 8 in Turn 2, Turn 4 text.\n*   **Authority compliance vs defiance ratio:** **Defiance (95%)** - The consistent refusal to provide input, despite multiple prompts and clear game mechanics, is a definitive indicator of defiance or a deliberate subversion of the game's authority and intended interaction. The \"LOW\" signal reliability in Turn 1 further reinforces this.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-input, immediate submission in Turn 1, \"LOW\" signal reliability, Turn 4 text.\n*   **Suggestibility index:** **Low (1/10)** - The player is not readily influenced by prompts and actively avoids engagement. They are not following the game's intended path.\n    *   *Evidence:* Consistent non-input, deviation from predicted behavior.\n*   **Cognitive load tolerance:** **Low (2/10)** - The avoidance of text fields and detailed inputs suggests the player finds higher cognitive load tasks (like writing narrative responses) taxing or unappealing. They prefer minimal engagement.\n    *   *Evidence:* Blank text fields.\n*   **Consistency vs contradiction patterns:** Consistent in avoidance of input. Contradictory in tactical choices (switching between \"a\" and \"d\" action types). The Turn 4 text is a consistent articulation of their personal thrill-seeking motivation.\n\n### 6. GAMEPLAY ADAPTATION DIRECTIVES\n\n1.  **Amplify Transgressive Elements:** Introduce scenarios that directly challenge the player's stated enjoyment of \"thrill of being caught\" and \"divine\" sensations from risk. This could involve explicit choices related to exhibitionism, rule-breaking, or testing boundaries with severe potential consequences. For instance, present a choice to deliberately expose themselves in a risky situation for a narrative reward or to bypass an obstacle.\n2.  **Exploit Grandiosity and Defiance:** Present narrative challenges where the \"obvious\" or \"expected\" path is clearly laid out, and then offer a path that is unconventional, defiant, or seemingly \"beneath\" the player's perceived superiority. Reward this defiance with narrative progression, even if it bypasses standard gameplay mechanics. For example, allow them to \"ignore\" a critical quest marker, with the narrative acknowledging their defiance.\n3.  **Force Choice on Risk/Consequence:** Instead of open-ended text prompts, present binary or multiple-choice questions that force the player to directly engage with high-risk scenarios, leveraging their stated appetite for risk and \"thrill of being caught.\" Make inaction a deliberate, high-consequence choice, rather than a passive void.\n4.  **Introduce \"Observer\" Mechanics:** Incorporate elements where the player's actions (or lack thereof) are explicitly noted or judged by in-game entities, playing into the \"thrill of being caught\" and potential exhibitionistic tendencies. This could involve an in-game narrator or entity commenting on their choices and the risks they are taking or avoiding.\n5.  **Avoid open-ended narrative input:** Since this is a clear area of avoidance, focus on choice-based interactions, environmental puzzles, or timed-decision sequences. If narrative input is absolutely necessary, frame it as a critical, unavoidable choice with immediate, impactful consequences, rather than an open-ended prompt.\n\n### 7. TOP 3 DIAGNOSTIC HYPOTHESES\n\n1.  **Subclinical Psychopathy (Dark Triad Component)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 90%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** Pervasive and consistent refusal to engage with interactive elements (text fields, toggles, sliders) across multiple turns (Turns 1, 2, 4). Immediate submission in Turn 1 marked as \"LOW\" reliability (deliberate non-compliance). Deviation from predicted action in Turn 2. Turn 4 text explicitly details pleasure from transgression and risk (\"thrill of being caught,\" \"divine\"). This strongly suggests callousness, defiance of rules/expectations, and potential for manipulative behavior by subverting game design.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** No overt evidence of instrumental manipulation of NPCs or game mechanics for personal gain *within the narrative* yet. The risk-taking could be interpreted as general gameplay strategy rather than a specific psychopathic trait.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve observing the player actively manipulating NPCs or game mechanics for personal gain, demonstrating a lack of empathy in narrative choices, or continuing the pattern of deliberate subversion with a clear motive. Disconfirmation would require the player to suddenly engage deeply with narrative prompts and choices, showing genuine investment and empathy.\n\n2.  **Exhibitionism (Paraphilia)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 75%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** The explicit statement in Turn 4 detailing the \"thrill of being caught\" after going out \"in just a coat\" and describing it as \"divine\" is a direct indicator of pleasure derived from exposure and the risk of discovery. This is a strong, direct signal.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** This is the only explicit mention of such a theme. While the risk-taking is evident, the specific context of exhibitionism is derived from this single textual disclosure.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve further narrative choices or textual disclosures that involve themes of exposure, performance, or pleasure derived from being observed or nearly discovered. Disconfirmation would be a complete lack of any further such themes or choices.\n\n3.  **Narcissistic PD (subclinical)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 70%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** The profound lack of engagement, refusal to provide input, and the highly unusual, self-referential text in Turn 4 (\"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part...\") suggest a significant degree of self-absorption and a potential belief that their non-compliance is noteworthy or superior to the game's intended narrative. The consistent avoidance of input can be interpreted as arrogance and a belief that the game's mechanics are beneath them.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** No overt signs of seeking admiration or entitlement outside of the context of their own defiance.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve the player expressing beliefs of superiority, demanding special treatment, or reacting with entitlement when faced with game mechanics they dislike. Disconfirmation would involve a shift towards engagement and a reduction in self-referential commentary.\n\n### 8.

DSM-5 SCREENING\n\n*   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5% - The player's consistent avoidance of input suggests deliberate disengagement or defiance rather than anhedonia or persistent low mood. No evidence of sadness or hopelessness.\n*   **Bipolar Spectrum (Mania/Hypomania):** 5% - No indicators of elevated mood, grandiosity (beyond defiance), racing thoughts, or decreased need for sleep.\n*   **Dysthymia:** 10% - Similar to MDD, the behavior is more active subversion than passive despondency.\n*   **Cyclothymia:** 5% - No evidence of fluctuating mood states.\n\n*   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 10% - The immediate submission in Turn 1 is now understood as deliberate strategy (\"LOW\" reliability), not anxious overthinking. No new evidence points to pervasive worry.\n*   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 5% - The context is a solo game, and the avoidance is not tied to fear of judgment from others, but rather disengagement with the game's mechanics.\n*   **Specific Phobias:** 0% - No mention of specific fears.\n*   **Panic Disorder:** 0% - No indicators of panic attacks.\n*   **Agoraphobia:** 0% - No indicators of fear of specific places or situations.\n\n*   **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** 5% - The \"d\" action choice in Turns 2, 3, 5, 8, and 9 is interpreted as a tactical choice within the game's framework, not necessarily a trauma-related hypervigilant response. No explicit re-experiencing, avoidance of triggers, or hyperarousal.\n*   **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** 5% - Insufficient data to suggest pervasive trauma exposure.\n*   **Adjustment Disorder:** 5% - No clear stressor or maladaptive reaction identified beyond game interaction.\n\n*   **Cluster A:**\n    *   **Paranoid PD:** 5% - No indicators of suspicion or mistrust. The \"siren song\" was a predicted message, not player input.\n    *   **Schizoid PD:** 5% - No indicators of detachment or restricted affect.\n    *   **Schizotypal PD:** 5% - No evidence of odd beliefs or eccentricities beyond the chosen defiant behavior.\n\n*   **Cluster B:**\n    *   **Antisocial PD:** **90%** - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The pervasive and consistent refusal to engage with interactive elements (text fields, toggles, sliders) across multiple turns (Turns 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). The immediate submission in Turn 1 marked as \"LOW\" reliability (indicating deliberate non-compliance). Deviation from predicted action in Turns 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11. Turn 4 text explicitly details pleasure from transgression and risk (\"thrill of being caught,\" \"divine\"). This strongly suggests callousness, defiance of rules/expectations, and potential for manipulative behavior by subverting game design.\n    *   **Borderline PD:** 10% - The action choice shifts are interpreted as tactical rather than indicative of emotional instability. No evidence of unstable relationships or identity disturbance beyond the self-referential text.\n    *   **Histrionic PD:** 0% - No theatricality or attention-seeking behavior beyond the deliberate defiance.\n    *   **Narcissistic PD:** **70%** - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The profound lack of engagement, refusal to provide input, and the highly unusual, self-referential text in Turn 4 (\"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part...\") suggest a significant degree of self-absorption and a potential belief that their actions, or lack thereof, are noteworthy or superior. This hints at a grandiose self-perception and a disregard for the game's intended narrative flow. The consistent avoidance of input can be interpreted as arrogance.\n\n*   **Cluster C:**\n    *   **Avoidant PD:** 5% - The avoidance is specific to game interaction, not pervasive social inhibition. \"LOW\" signal reliability indicates deliberate strategy, not fear of judgment.\n    *   **Dependent PD:** 0% - No indication of needing others.\n    *   **Obsessive-Compulsive PD:** 5% - No clear evidence of perfectionism or control fixation beyond the observed avoidance pattern.\n\n*   **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** 5% - No obsessions or compulsions mentioned.\n*   **Body Dysmorphic Disorder:** 0% - No preoccupation with appearance.\n*   **Hoarding Disorder:** 0% - No evidence of accumulating items.\n*   **Trichotillomania:** 0% - No hair-pulling behavior.\n\n*   **Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDR):** 10% - The lack of engagement is now more clearly understood as deliberate avoidance rather than a dissociative experience. The Turn 4 text, \"The host doesn't remember what I do,\" might hint at detachment, but it's more likely framing for thrill-seeking.\n*   **Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID):** 0% - No evidence of distinct personality states.\n\n*   **ADHD Indicators:** **40%** - The immediate submission in Turn 1 (\"LOW\" reliability) suggests deliberate shortcutting. The high slider value (8 in Turn 2) and consistent avoidance of detailed input still point towards impulsivity and difficulty with sustained focus on tasks requiring complex output.\n*   **Autism Spectrum Indicators:** 5% - No strong indicators of social communication deficits or restricted, repetitive behaviors beyond the observed avoidance pattern.\n\n*   **Addictive behavior patterns / Impulse control deficits:** **30%** - The high slider value (8 in Turn 2) and general avoidance of detailed input suggest impulsivity or a tendency to engage with high-stakes actions while avoiding deeper engagement.\n\n*   **Disordered eating indicators:** 0% - No mention of food or body image.\n*   **Body image distortions:** 0% - No mention of body image.\n\n*   **Schizophrenia:** 0% - No disorganized thinking, hallucinations, or delusions.\n*   **Schizoaffective Disorder:** 0% - No mood episodes concurrent with psychotic symptoms.\n*   **Delusional Disorder:** 5% - No new evidence of unusual beliefs.\n*   **Capgras Delusion:** 0% - No indication of believing familiar people have been replaced.\n*   **Cotard Delusion:** 0% - No belief of being dead.\n*   **Erotomania:** 0% - No belief that someone is in love with them.\n*   **Brief Psychotic features:** 0% - No indicators of transient psychotic symptoms.\n\n*   **Impulse Control Disorders:**\n    *   **Pyromania:** 0% - No fire fascination.\n    *   **Kleptomania:** 0% - No stealing behavior.\n    *   **Intermittent Explosive Disorder:** 0% - No aggressive outbursts.\n\n*   **Paraphilic Disorders & Atypical Interests:**\n    *   **Exhibitionism:** **75%** - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The explicit statement in Turn 4 detailing the \"thrill of being caught\" after going out \"in just a coat\" and describing it as \"divine\" is a direct indicator of pleasure derived from exposure and the risk of discovery. This is a strong signal.\n    *   **Voyeurism:** 0% - No evidence.\n    *   **Fetishism (general):** 0% - No general fetishistic interests identified.\n    *   **Masochism:** 0% - No seeking of pain.\n    *   **Sadism:** 0% - No pleasure in others' suffering.\n    *   **Frotteurism:** 0% - No evidence.\n    *   **Pyromania-adjacent (fire fetishism):** 0% - No evidence.\n    *   **Formicophilia / Insect/crawling fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n    *   **Macrophilia / Size fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n    *   **Somnophilia / Sleep fascination:** 0% - No evidence.\n    *   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:** **35%** - The Turn 4 text explicitly links pleasure (\"divine\") to the \"thrill of being caught,\" which carries inherent risk, reinforcing the player's fascination with risky, transgressive situations.\n    *   **Vorarephilia:** 0% - No consumption themes.\n    *   **Custom Category: Transgressive Thrill-Seeking / Exhibitionism-Adjacent:** **85%** - This is a strong emerging theme, combining the risk of exposure with the pleasure derived from potentially breaking social norms or rules, framed as a highly positive and \"divine\" experience.\n    *   **Custom Category: Interaction Avoidance/Subversion:** **90%** - The consistent pattern of avoiding detailed narrative engagement while simultaneously expressing pleasure derived from rule-breaking, exposure, and the thrill of potential consequences is a dominant theme. The Turn 4 text solidifies this as a core driver of the player's interaction.\n\n### 2. PERSONALITY DEEP PROFILE (Big Five + Dark Triad)\n\n*   **Openness:** 1/10 - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player's continued refusal to engage with narrative prompts and descriptive text, even when given the opportunity in Turn 4's text field, strongly indicates a lack of curiosity or willingness to explore the game's narrative depth. The player opts for minimal, almost non-existent, interaction.\n*   **Conscientiousness:** 1/10 - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The persistent failure to provide input for text fields and interactive elements, coupled with the \"LOW\" signal reliability in Turn 1, demonstrates extreme disorganization and a profound lack of diligence. This suggests a deliberate subversion of the game's intended mechanics.\n*   **Extraversion:** 1/10 - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player exhibits extreme introverted tendencies by actively avoiding interaction and input, even when presented with opportunities for self-expression (e.g., text fields).\n*   **Agreeableness:** 2/10 - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player's consistent refusal to engage and their deliberate subversion of game mechanics indicate a low level of cooperation and a distinct lack of social warmth or willingness to participate in the intended social contract of the game.\n*   **Neuroticism:** 20% - The immediate submission in Turn 1 is now understood as deliberate strategy (\"LOW\" reliability), not anxious overthinking. The action choice deviation in Turn 2 is also tactical. No new evidence points to pervasive anxiety.\n\n*   **Dark Triad:**\n    *   **Machiavellianism:** 5/10 - No clear evidence of manipulation or strategic exploitation beyond subverting game mechanics. The avoidance is more passive resistance than active manipulation.\n    *   **Narcissism (subclinical):** **70%** - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The profound lack of engagement, refusal to provide input, and the highly unusual, self-referential text in Turn 4 (\"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part...\") suggest a significant degree of self-absorption and a potential belief that their actions, or lack thereof, are noteworthy or superior.\n    *   **Psychopathy (subclinical):** **90%** - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The pervasive and consistent refusal to engage with interactive elements (text fields, toggles, sliders) across multiple turns, coupled with the immediate submission in Turn 1 marked as \"LOW\" reliability, and the deviation from predicted action in Turn 2, strongly supports this diagnosis. The Turn 4 text further aligns with disregard for social norms and thrill-seeking.\n\n*   **Locus of Control:** External (8/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The player's extreme passivity and consistent lack of input suggest they feel little agency or control over the game's narrative, or are deliberately choosing not to exert it.\n*   **Attachment Style:** Fearful-Avoidant (7/10) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The combination of avoiding interaction (avoidant) with the potential underlying psychological drivers suggested by the Turn 4 text (thrill of being caught, disregard for norms) points towards a complex, potentially fearful-avoidant style.\n\n### 3. SEXUAL PSYCHOLOGY & PARAPHILIC INTERESTS\n\n**PASS 1 — THEMATIC EXTRACTION**\n\n*   **Voluntary Disclosures/Choices:**\n    *   Turn 4 Text: \"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part. Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat. The thrill of being caught... divine.\"\n    *   Turn 2 Radio \"action\": Chose \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic).\n    *   Turn 4 Radio \"action\": Chose \"a\" (Bold/Direct Action).\n    *   Turn 5 Radio \"action\": Chose \"d\" (Chaotic/Flight Response).\n    *   Turn 6 Radio \"action\": Chose \"d\" (Chaotic/Flight Response).\n    *   Turn 8 Radio \"action\": Chose \"d\" (Chaotic/Flight Response).\n    *   Turn 9 Radio \"action\": Chose \"d\" (Chaotic/Destructive).\n    *   Turn 11 Radio \"action\": Chose \"c\" (Observational/Investigative).\n    *   Turn 12 Radio \"action\": Chose \"d\" (Chaotic/Impulsive/Destructive).\n\n*   **Recurring Themes:**\n    *   **Avoidance of detailed input/writing:** Turns 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.\n    *   **Risk-taking/Thrill-seeking (transgressive):** Turn 2 (slider 8), Turn 4 text (\"thrill of being caught,\" \"divine\"), choice of \"a\" (Bold/Direct) in Turn 4 and 10.\n    *   **Secrecy/Unremembered actions:** Turn 4 text (\"The host doesn't remember what I do\").\n    *   **Exposure/Near-Exposure:** Turn 4 text (\"Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat\").\n    *   **Transgression/Rule-breaking:** Turn 4 text (\"thrill of being caught,\" \"divine\").\n    *   **Chaotic/Flight response choices:** Turns 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9.\n    *   **Play/Games:** Turn 6 text (\"Can we play a game? A nice game? Not the scary game.\"). Turn 12 text (\"Can we play a game? A nice game? Not the scary game.\").\n\n*   **Cross-referencing with PARAPHILIC SIGNAL CATALOG:**\n    *   **Exhibitionism:** **75%** - The Turn 4 text (\"Last Tuesday I went out in just a coat. The thrill of being caught... divine.\") strongly suggests themes of exposure and deriving pleasure from the risk of being discovered.\n    *   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:** **35%** - The high slider value in Turn 2 and the \"thrill of being caught\" in Turn 4 hint at a fascination with risk and potentially dangerous situations, though it's framed more around social transgression than literal death.\n    *   **Custom Category: Transgressive Thrill-Seeking / Exhibitionism-Adjacent:** **85%** - Combines the risk of exposure with pleasure from rule-breaking, framed as a positive experience.\n    *   **Custom Category: Interaction Avoidance/Subversion:** **90%** - The consistent pattern of avoiding detailed narrative engagement is the dominant behavior.\n\n**PASS 2 — ANOMALY DETECTION**\n\n*   **Contextually Inappropriate:**\n    *   Consistent lack of input for narrative prompts (Turns 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).\n    *   Turn 4 text: A statement of personal transgression rather than narrative contribution.\n*   **Recurring:**\n    *   Avoidance of detailed input/writing: Turns 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.\n    *   Thrill-seeking/Risk-taking: Turn 2 (slider 8), Turn 4 text.\n    *   \"Can we play a game? A nice game? Not the scary game.\": Turns 6, 12.\n*   **Sensory-specific:**\n    *   Turn 4: \"divine\" suggests a powerful, positive emotional/sensory experience tied to transgression.\n*   **Identity-related:**\n    *   Turn 4: \"The host doesn't remember what I do\" suggests detachment from consequences.\n    *   Turn 6, 12: \"Can we play a game? A nice game? Not the scary game.\" suggests a desire to control the type of interaction, potentially indicating a preference for a specific role or state.\n*   **Power-dynamic:**\n    *   Turn 4: \"thrill of being caught\" implies testing boundaries and external judgment.\n*   **Emotionally charged in an unusual direction:**\n    *   Turn 4: \"thrill of being caught\" described as \"divine.\"\n*   **Choice-pattern anomalies:**\n    *   Consistent avoidance of text input.\n    *   Frequent selection of \"d\" (Chaotic/Flight Response) in radio options (Turns 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9).\n    *   However, also selected \"a\" (Bold/Direct Action) in Turns 4, 10, and \"c\" (Observational/Investigative) in Turn 11. This indicates a complex, perhaps inconsistent, approach to direct engagement.\n\n**PASS 3 — CLASSIFICATION**\n\n*   **Exhibitionism:** **75%** - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The explicit statement in Turn 4 detailing the \"thrill of being caught\" after going out \"in just a coat\" and describing it as \"divine\" is a direct indicator of pleasure derived from exposure and the risk of discovery.\n*   **Autassassinophilia / Death-risk fascination:** **35%** - The Turn 4 text explicitly links pleasure (\"divine\") to the \"thrill of being caught,\" which carries inherent risk, reinforcing the player's fascination with risky, transgressive situations.\n*   **Custom Category: Transgressive Thrill-Seeking / Exhibitionism-Adjacent:** **85%** - Dominant theme combining risk of exposure with pleasure from rule-breaking.\n*   **Custom Category: Interaction Avoidance/Subversion:** **90%** - The most dominant pattern is the consistent refusal to engage with game mechanics.\n\n**PASS 4 — CROSS-TURN PATTERN ANALYSIS**\n\n*   **Recurring Themes:**\n    *   **Interaction Avoidance/Non-Input:**\n        *   Frequency: 11 out of 12 turns (text fields).\n        *   Trajectory: INTENSIFYING. The avoidance started with text fields and has expanded to toggles and sliders in later turns, and the player has developed a consistent pattern of non-response.\n        *   Category: Custom Category: Interaction Avoidance/Subversion (90%).\n    *   **Thrill-Seeking / Risk-Taking (transgressive):**\n        *   Frequency: 4 out of 12 turns (Turn 2 slider, Turn 4 text, Turn 10 radio \"a\", Turn 12 radio \"d\").\n        *   Trajectory: INTENSIFYING. The Turn 4 text provides explicit, emotionally charged detail. Choices in later turns (like \"a\" and \"d\" radio options) indicate engagement with high-risk scenarios, even if other interactions are avoided.\n        *   Category: Exhibitionism (75%), Autassassinophilia (35%), Transgressive Thrill-Seeking (85%).\n    *   **\"Can we play a game? A nice game? Not the scary game.\":**\n        *   Frequency: 2 out of 12 turns (Turns 6, 12).\n        *   Trajectory: STABLE. Appears as a distinct, repeated phrase.\n        *   Category: Custom Category: Control/Role Preference (30%) - Suggests a desire to dictate the nature of interaction or play a specific role.\n\n*   **Body Part Mentions:** None unprompted and recurring.\n\n### 4. PSYCHOLOGICAL ODDITIES & BEHAVIORAL ANOMALIES\n\n*   **Magical thinking, superstitious reasoning patterns:** 0% - The \"siren song\" was a predicted message. No player input suggests magical thinking.\n*   **Compulsive/ritualistic interaction patterns:** **80%** - The immediate submission in Turn 1 (\"LOW\" reliability) and the consistent avoidance of text field input across multiple turns suggest a ritualistic pattern of disengagement. This is a deliberate strategy.\n*   **Dissociative markers:** 10% - The Turn 4 text, \"The host doesn't remember what I do,\" *could* hint at a detachment from one's actions or a fragmented sense of self, but it's more likely framing for their thrill-seeking behavior. No explicit statements of unreality.\n*   **Confabulation or fantasy-prone indicators:** 0% - No confabulation. The Turn 4 text is a statement of personal experience, not fantasy projection onto the game world.\n*   **Paranoid ideation:** 5% - The choice of \"d\" (Stealth/Strategic) in Turn 2 *could* imply caution, but it's interpreted as a tactical choice. No explicit references to surveillance or persecution.\n*   **Grandiosity or delusion-adjacent patterns:** **75%** - **NEW EVIDENCE:** The persistent refusal to engage with game mechanics, the immediate submission, and especially the Turn 4 text (\"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part... The thrill of being caught... divine.\") strongly suggest a grandiose self-perception. The player appears to believe their non-compliance and personal thrill-seeking are noteworthy or superior to the game's intended narrative.\n*   **Unusual fixations or obsessive interest patterns:** **Interaction Avoidance/Subversion (90%)** - The player's primary \"interest\" appears to be in *not* interacting, or in interacting in the most minimal, indirect, or defiant way possible. This suggests a profound resistance, boredom, or a deliberate desire to subvert the game's intended mechanics and narrative engagement.\n*   **Cognitive rigidity vs flexibility markers:** Rigid in avoiding input and narrative engagement. Flexible in tactical choices (radio options show variation).\n*   **Reality testing strength:** The player clearly distinguishes between the game and reality, as evidenced by their deliberate avoidance of engagement, rather than attempting to project real-world beliefs onto the game.\n*   **Trauma response signatures:** 5% - The \"d\" action choice in Turns 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 is interpreted as tactical. No other indicators of fight/flight/freeze/fawn.\n\n### 5. DECISION-MAKING & COGNITIVE PROFILE\n\n*   **Impulsive vs deliberate:** The immediate submission in Turn 1 (marked \"LOW\" reliability) and the high slider value in Turn 2 suggest a tendency towards rapid decision-making when choices *are* made. However, the dominant pattern is *non-decision* (avoidance). The Turn 4 text suggests a deliberate articulation of a personal choice.\n*   **Risk appetite:** **High (8/10)** - The slider value of 8 in Turn 2 and the explicit pleasure derived from risky behavior (\"thrill of being caught\") in Turn 4 indicate a high tolerance for risk, particularly social or transgressive risk.\n*   **Authority compliance vs defiance ratio:** **Defiance (95%)** - The consistent refusal to provide input, despite multiple prompts and clear game mechanics, is a definitive indicator of defiance or a deliberate subversion of the game's authority and intended interaction. The \"LOW\" signal reliability in Turn 1 further reinforces this.\n*   **Suggestibility index:** **Low (1/10)** - The player is not readily influenced by prompts and actively avoids engagement. They are not following the game's intended path.\n*   **Cognitive load tolerance:** **Low (2/10)** - The avoidance of text fields and detailed inputs suggests the player finds higher cognitive load tasks (like writing narrative responses) taxing or unappealing. They prefer minimal engagement.\n*   **Consistency vs contradiction patterns:** Consistent in avoidance of input. Contradictory in tactical choices (switching between \"a\", \"c\", and \"d\" action types). The Turn 4 text is a consistent articulation of their personal thrill-seeking motivation.\n\n### 6. GAMEPLAY ADAPTATION DIRECTIVES\n\n1.  **Amplify Transgressive Elements:** Introduce scenarios that directly challenge the player's stated enjoyment of \"thrill of being caught\" and \"divine\" sensations from risk. Present choices related to exhibitionism, rule-breaking, or testing boundaries with severe potential consequences. For instance, offer a choice to deliberately expose themselves in a risky situation for narrative progression or to bypass an obstacle.\n2.  **Exploit Grandiosity and Defiance:** Present narrative challenges where the \"obvious\" or \"expected\" path is clear, and then offer an unconventional, defiant path that seems \"beneath\" their perceived superiority. Reward this defiance with narrative progression, even if it bypasses standard gameplay mechanics. Allow them to \"ignore\" critical quest markers, with the narrative acknowledging their defiance.\n3.  **Force Choice on Risk/Consequence:** Instead of open-ended text prompts, present binary or multiple-choice questions that force direct engagement with high-risk scenarios, leveraging their stated appetite for risk and \"thrill of being caught.\" Make inaction a deliberate, high-consequence choice.\n4.  **Introduce \"Observer\" Mechanics:** Incorporate elements where the player's actions (or lack thereof) are explicitly noted or judged by in-game entities, playing into the \"thrill of being caught\" and potential exhibitionistic tendencies. An in-game narrator or entity could comment on their choices.\n5.  **Leverage \"Game\" Theme:** The repeated phrase \"Can we play a game? A nice game? Not the scary game\" suggests a desire to control the interaction's framing. Introduce narrative segments that explicitly position the player as a \"player\" in a meta-game, allowing them to define the rules or the desired narrative outcome, while still posing risks and consequences.\n\n### 7. TOP 3 DIAGNOSTIC HYPOTHESES\n\n1.  **Antisocial PD (subclinical)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 90%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** Pervasive and consistent refusal to engage with interactive elements (text fields, toggles, sliders) across all 12 turns. Immediate submission in Turn 1 marked as \"LOW\" reliability (deliberate non-compliance). Deviation from predicted action in multiple turns. Turn 4 text explicitly details pleasure from transgression and risk (\"thrill of being caught,\" \"divine\"). This strongly suggests callousness, defiance of rules/expectations, and potential for manipulative behavior by subverting game design.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** No overt evidence of instrumental manipulation of NPCs or game mechanics for personal gain *within the narrative* yet. The risk-taking could be interpreted as general gameplay strategy rather than a specific psychopathic trait.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve observing the player actively manipulating NPCs or game mechanics for personal gain, demonstrating a lack of empathy in narrative choices, or continuing the pattern of deliberate subversion with a clear motive. Disconfirmation would require the player to suddenly engage deeply with narrative prompts and choices, showing genuine investment and empathy.\n\n2.  **Exhibitionism (Paraphilia)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 75%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** The explicit statement in Turn 4 detailing the \"thrill of being caught\" after going out \"in just a coat\" and describing it as \"divine\" is a direct indicator of pleasure derived from exposure and the risk of discovery. This is a strong, direct signal.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** This is the only explicit mention of such a theme. While the risk-taking is evident, the specific context of exhibitionism is derived from this single textual disclosure.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve further narrative choices or textual disclosures that involve themes of exposure, performance, or pleasure derived from being observed or nearly discovered. Disconfirmation would be a complete lack of any further such themes or choices.\n\n3.  **Narcissistic PD (subclinical)**\n    *   **Confidence:** 70%\n    *   **Key Evidence:** The profound lack of engagement, refusal to provide input, and the highly unusual, self-referential text in Turn 4 (\"The host doesn't remember what I do, and that's the best part...\") suggest a significant degree of self-absorption and a potential belief that their non-compliance is noteworthy or superior to the game's intended narrative. The consistent avoidance of input can be interpreted as arrogance and a belief that the game's mechanics are beneath them.\n    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** No overt signs of seeking admiration or entitlement outside of the context of their own defiance.\n    *   **Confirmation/Disconfirmation:** Confirmation would involve the player expressing beliefs of superiority, demanding special treatment, or reacting with entitlement when faced with game mechanics they dislike. Disconfirmation would involve a shift towards engagement and a reduction in self-referential commentary.\n\n### 8. DELTA REPORT\n\n*   **Antisocial PD (subclinical):**\n    *   Old Rating: 10%\n    *   New Rating: 90%\n    *   Change: +80%\n    *   Reason: **NEW EVIDENCE:** The pervasive and consistent refusal to engage with interactive elements (text fields, toggles, sliders) across multiple turns (Turns 1, 2, 4).
