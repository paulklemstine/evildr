This is a complex interaction, and the player's minimal textual input alongside high-risk action choices paints a picture of a unique psychological landscape. Let's break it down.

## 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5% - No sustained low mood, anhedonia, or vegetative symptoms. Engagement with the game, however minimal, suggests some level of interest.
*   **Bipolar Spectrum:** 5% - No manic or hypomanic episodes observed.
*   **Dysthymia:** 5% - No chronic low-grade depression observed.
*   **Cyclothymia:** 5% - No fluctuating mood states observed.
*   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 10% - While impulsive, there's no pervasive worry or excessive anxiety. The quick choices suggest decisiveness or impatience, not generalized worry.
*   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 5% - Lack of text input without explicit fear of judgment or social inhibition is not indicative of social anxiety.
*   **Specific Phobias:** 0% - No phobic stimuli or avoidance patterns identified.
*   **Panic Disorder:** 0% - No reported panic attacks or fear of future attacks.
*   **Agoraphobia:** 0% - No avoidance of situations where escape might be difficult.
*   **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** 5% - No hypervigilance, flashbacks, or survival framing are evident.
*   **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** 5% - Insufficient data for a pervasive trauma pattern.
*   **Adjustment Disorder:** 5% - No clear stressors identified.
*   **Paranoid PD:** 5% - No overt suspiciousness or distrust.
*   **Schizoid PD:** 0% - No evidence of social detachment or restricted emotional expression.
*   **Schizotypal PD:** 5% - No clear indicators of magical thinking or odd beliefs beyond choice patterns.
*   **Antisocial PD:** 45% - Impulsivity (high slider values, activation of unknown mechanisms), disregard for thoroughness (lack of text input), and unpredictable strategic shifts (choice of "action: d" in Turns 2 and 4) suggest a pattern of self-interest and potential disregard for protocols. Turn 4's choice of "action: d" over predicted analytical/bold options reinforces this. The lack of concern for consequences is also noted.
*   **Borderline PD:** 5% - No clear evidence of unstable relationships, identity disturbance, affective instability, etc.
*   **Histrionic PD:** 0% - No theatricality or excessive attention-seeking.
*   **Narcissistic PD:** 35% - Consistent push for high-intensity experiences and selection of forceful or fate-driven actions (rather than analytical ones) suggest a self-centered drive for stimulation and a belief in their own ability to navigate extreme situations, bordering on grandiosity. The choice of "action: d" implies a belief in their own exceptional capacity to handle chaos.
*   **Avoidant PD:** 0% - No social inhibition or fear of rejection.
*   **Dependent PD:** 0% - No submissiveness or need for care.
*   **Obsessive-Compulsive PD:** 15% - The consistent high slider values and activation of unknown mechanisms could hint at a preference fo

  ── Analysis Summary (1-12) ──
This is a complex case, and the player's engagement has certainly provided a rich tapestry of data. Let's dissect it.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

**Mood Disorders:**
*   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5% - No sustained indicators of anhedonia, pervasive low mood, or significant functional impairment. The initial non-input is insufficient.
*   **Bipolar Spectrum:** 5% - No evidence of manic or hypomanic episodes. Choices may be erratic, but not indicative of elevated energy or grandiosity.
*   **Dysthymia:** 10% - Mild dissatisfaction could be inferred from initial non-input and choice deviations, but lacks sustained depressive mood.
*   **Cyclothymia:** 5% - No clear pattern of alternating hypomanic and depressive symptoms.

**Anxiety Disorders:**
*   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 25% - "They're all watching" (Turn 2) and suspicion about prompt phrasing (Turn 9) suggest apprehension. However, it's not pervasive across multiple contexts outside the immediate experimental setup. (DECREASED from 30% due to lack of generalized worry statements).
*   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 5% - Initial non-input is unreliable. Player engages in subsequent turns. No explicit fear of judgment or self-deprecation. (DECREASED from 15%).
*   **Specific Phobias:** 0% - No indicators of fear related to specific objects or situations.
*   **Panic Disorder:** 0% - No indicators of panic attacks.
*   **Agoraphobia:** 0% - No indicators of fear of situations where escape might be difficult.

**Trauma & Stressor:**
*   **PTSD:** 30% - "They're all watching" (Turn 2) suggests hypervigilance. Choice deviations could be stress responses. However, no explicit re-experiencing, avoidance of specific triggers, or clear survival framing beyond general risk engagement. (DECREASED from 40% due to lack of new, specific trauma indicators beyond hypervigilance).
*   **Complex PTSD:** 5% - Insufficient evidence of pervasive trauma exposure and relational difficulties.
*   **Adjustment Disorder:** 5% - No clear evidence of distress disproportionate to an identifiable stressor outside the experimental context.

**Personality Disorders:**
*   **Cluster A:**
    *   **Paranoid PD:** 35% - "They're all watching" (Turn 2) and questioning prompt phrasing (Turn 9) indicate suspiciousness. However, the paranoia is largely directed at the observer/experiment, not generalized. (DECREASED from 35%, as it is specific to the context).
    *   **Schizoid PD:** 0% - No indicators of detachment, emotional restriction, or lack of interest in social relationships.
    *   **Schizotypal PD:** 80% - **CONFIRMED & INCREASED.** The distinct internal voices (Turn 2, 5, 6) are highly indicative of odd beliefs, magical thinking, and unusual perceptual experiences. The feeling of being watched aligns with paranoid ideation. The engagement with these internal constructs is strong and consistent. (INCREASED from 75%).
*   **Cluster B:**
    *   **Antisocial PD:** 0% - No evidence of disregard for others, dece

### PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE

**1. DSM-5 SCREENING**

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   Major Depressive Disorder: 5% (No persistent low mood, anhedonia, or vegetative symptoms. Player engagement is active, albeit selective and defiant.)
    *   Bipolar Spectrum: 5% (No manic or hypomanic episodes observed.)
    *   Dysthymia: 10% (Defiant and ritualistic behaviors do not strongly suggest pervasive hopelessness.)
    *   Cyclothymia: 5% (No distinct periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms.)

*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   GAD: 15% (Decisive, defiant, and ritualistic choices suggest internal commitment, not pervasive worry. Initial avoidance is task-oriented, not generalized anxiety.)
    *   Social Anxiety Disorder: 10% (No explicit fear of judgment or social inhibition. Avoidance is task-focused and defiant, not socially inhibited.)
    *   Specific Phobias: 0% (No new evidence.)
    *   Panic Disorder: 10% (Emojis like "😒" and "😠" suggest detachment or disdain rather than panic, though the scenario is high-stress. The ritualistic behavior may be a coping mechanism for anxiety.)
    *   Agoraphobia: 0% (No new evidence.)

*   **Trauma & Stressor Related Disorders:**
    *   PTSD: 30% (Turn 4 text: "I check behind me every 30 seconds. Force of habit. The last time I didn't check, I woke up in a hospital," strongly indicates a traumatic event and learned hypervigilance. This remains a primary driver.)
    *   Complex PTSD (C-PTSD): 20% (Combination of potential trauma (Turn 4) and emergent defiance, control, and avoidance suggests a complex response to past experiences beyond a single event.)
    *   Adjustment Disorder: 5% (Active engagement, even if defiant, suggests adaptation rather than a simple adjustment disorder.)

*   **Personality Disorders:**
    *   Cluster A:
        *   Paranoid PD: 35% (Vigilance in Turn 4 can be paranoid ideation, framed as trauma response, not pervasive distrust. The player consistently chooses defiance over external directives, suggesting suspicion of authority.)
        *   Schizoid PD: 5% (No evidence of detachment from social relationships or restricted emotional expression.)
        *   Schizotypal PD: 10% (The ritualistic behavior and potentially superstitious reasoning in Turn 4 could hint at odd beliefs, but not full-blown schizotypal traits.)
    *   Cluster B:
        *   Antisocial PD: 10% (Defiance is not necessarily manipulative or callous. Survival aggression in game context is not ASPD. The player's focus is on self-imposed control.)
        *   Borderline PD: 35% (Contrast between Turn 1 avoidance and Turn 2/4 defiance, coupled with unusual affect ("😒", "😠"), suggests potential emotional dysregulation. Turn 4 text hints at trauma and its effects, often associated with BPD. Emergent ritualistic control behavior also supports this.)
        *   Histrionic PD: 5% (Affect is more detached/disdainful than theatrical. No consistent attention-seeking behavior.)
        *   Narcissistic PD: 5% (No

  ── Analysis Summary (1-12) ──
This player presents a complex and volatile psychological landscape, marked by initial passivity that rapidly escalates into intense emotional reactivity, self-focus, and impulsive decision-making. The data strongly suggests a profile characterized by significant emotional dysregulation, a profound need for external validation, and a potential underlying impulse control deficit.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5% likelihood. The initial lack of engagement is too brief and context-dependent to suggest persistent anhedonia or a depressed mood state. (Previous: 5% - Stable).
    *   **Bipolar spectrum:** 5% likelihood. There are no indicators of elevated mood, mania, or hypomania. The rapid shifts are more indicative of emotional dysregulation than distinct mood episodes. (Previous: 5% - Stable).
    *   **Dysthymia:** 10% likelihood. The limited interaction window and the intensity of reactive engagement do not support a chronic, low-grade depressive state. (Previous: 10% - Stable).
    *   **Cyclothymia:** 5% likelihood. Insufficient evidence of fluctuating mood states that meet diagnostic criteria for cyclothymia. (Previous: 5% - Stable).

*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 35% likelihood. The extreme "unsettle" score (10/10) in Turn 2, combined with the choice of "need to know" (a) and the subsequent angry emoji reaction, indicates a heightened state of unease, vigilance, and a drive for clarity, consistent with underlying anxiety. However, this appears more as a reactive response to stimuli than pervasive worry. (Previous: 30% - **Increased** due to consistent reactivity and high "unsettle" score).
    *   **Social Anxiety:** 0% likelihood. The player engages directly and reactively, and the text in Turns 8/9 explicitly seeks external attention, contradicting social inhibition. (Previous: 0% - Stable).
    *   **Specific Phobias:** 0% likelihood. No specific phobic content or avoidance. (Previous: 0% - Stable).
    *   **Panic Disorder:** 0% likelihood. No reported physical symptoms or fear of losing control associated with panic attacks. (Previous: 0% - Stable).
    *   **Agoraphobia:** 0% likelihood. No avoidance of situations that might cause helplessness or panic. (Previous: 0% - Stable).

*   **Trauma & Stressor:**
    *   **PTSD:** 15% likelihood. The extreme "unsettle" score and angry reaction could be indicative of hyper-reactivity, but there are no specific trauma markers like flashbacks, intrusive memories, or avoidance of specific triggers related to a past event. (Previous: 15% - Stable).
    *   **Complex PTSD:** 10% likelihood. Insufficient evidence of pervasive interpersonal difficulties, disturbances in self-perception, or chronic emotional dysregulation over a longer period. (Previous: 10% - Stable).
    *   **Adjustment Disorder:** 15% likelihood. The player's intense reaction to the game's prompts suggests a significant stress resp

  ── Analysis Summary (1-12) ──
Here is a comprehensive psychological profile based on the provided interaction data:

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5% (↓15). No sustained low mood, anhedonia, or vegetative symptoms. The initial non-response is strategic, not depressive.
    *   **Bipolar Spectrum (Manic/Hypomanic):** 5% (↓10). Absence of elevated mood, racing thoughts, or inflated self-esteem.
    *   **Dysthymia:** 5% (↓15). Requires persistent low mood, which is not observed. The Turn 2 response is far too specific and engaged.
    *   **Cyclothymia:** 10% (↓5). While there's a shift from non-response to intense observation, there's no evidence of sustained mood lability.

*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 10% (↓10). Unease is highly specific to perceived imposture, not generalized worry.
    *   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 5% (↓10). Turn 1 non-response is unreliable. Turn 2 is an assertive, albeit paranoid, observation, not fear of judgment.
    *   **Specific Phobias:** 0%. No specific fears mentioned.
    *   **Panic Disorder:** 0%. No evidence of panic attacks.
    *   **Agoraphobia:** 0%. No avoidance of public places.

*   **Trauma & Stressor Related Disorders:**
    *   **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** 75% (↓0). The player's consistent, visceral reaction ("screams at me") to perceived anomalies, coupled with hypervigilance for subtle flaws ("way they hold their hands is wrong," "A fraction off"), strongly suggests a trauma response. The framing of "copy" and "not really them" indicates a deep-seated distrust that could stem from past traumatic experiences involving deception or betrayal. The persistence of this reaction across multiple turns reinforces its significance. *No new evidence in the latest turns, but the prior evidence remains compelling.*
    *   **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** 55% (↓0). The intensity, specificity, and repetitive nature of the player's observations suggest a deeply ingrained pattern of vigilance and distrust, aligning with C-PTSD. However, direct evidence of prolonged trauma is still lacking. *No new evidence in the latest turns, but the prior evidence remains compelling.*
    *   **Adjustment Disorder:** 5% (↓5). Too short-term and generalized.

*   **Personality Disorders:**
    *   **Cluster A:**
        *   **Paranoid PD:** 70% (↓0). The player's consistent suspicion of authenticity ("not really them," "copy") and focus on minute flaws as evidence of deception is a strong indicator. This is now reinforced by the repeated text and the development of an active testing strategy. *No new evidence in the latest turns, but the prior evidence remains compelling.*
        *   **Schizoid PD:** 0%. No evidence of detachment or emotional restriction.
        *   **Schizotypal PD:** 45% (↓5). The emphasis on unusual perceptual experiences ("1% screams at me") and the specific, odd focus on minute details ("way they hold their hands is wrong") re

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5% (0% previous). No new evidence of anhedonia or pervasive low mood. Previous rating was too high.
    *   **Bipolar Spectrum:** 0% (0% previous). No new evidence.
    *   **Dysthymia:** 5% (10% previous). Reduced due to active, albeit avoidant, engagement and creative text generation. Initial inaction is not necessarily a symptom of chronic low mood.
    *   **Cyclothymia:** 0% (0% previous). No new evidence.
*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 5% (5% previous). No new evidence suggesting pervasive worry. Slow response times are better explained by deliberate processing.
    *   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 0% (0% previous). No new evidence. Player's interaction style is not driven by social fear.
    *   **Specific Phobias:** 0% (0% previous). No new evidence.

    *   **Agoraphobia:** 0% (0% previous). No new evidence.
*   **Trauma & Stressor Related Disorders:**

        *   **Schizoid PD:** 0% (0% previous). No new evidence. Player engages, albeit unconventionally.
        *   **Schizotypal PD:** 5% (5% previous). No new evidence. Abstract choices are more indicative of openness and dissociation than odd thought patterns.
    *   **Cluster B:**
        *   **Antisocial PD:** 0% (0% previous). No new evidence.
        *   **Borderline PD:** 5% (5% previous). No new evidence. Deviations are consistent with internal logic, not necessarily affective instability.
        *   **Histrionic PD:** 15% (15% previous). Stable. Player's engagement with abstract, vivid themes and positive affect towards them (Turns 2, 3, 12) suggests a desire for heightened experience, though the initial silence is counter-indicative of overt attention-seeking.
        *   **Narcissistic PD:** 0% (0% previous). No new evidence.
    *   **Cluster C:**
        *   **Avoidant PD:** 0% (0% previous). No new evidence. Player's avoidance is strategic, not driven by inadequacy or fear of criticism.
        *   **Dependent PD:** 0% (0% previous). No new evidence.
        *   **Obsessive-Compulsive PD:** 5% (5% previous). No new evidence. Ritualistic interaction patterns are more indicative of executive function challenges than OCPD rigidity.

  ── Analysis Summary (1-12) ──
This is an intensive profiling request, and I will approach it with the rigor it demands. My analysis will be based solely on the provided interaction data, focusing on identifying patterns, deviations, and underlying psychological drivers.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING ###

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5% - No persistent low mood, anhedonia, or functional impairment. The initial lack of input (Turn 1) is too vague and context-dependent to diagnose.
    *   **Bipolar Spectrum (Mania/Hypomania):** 0% - No indicators of elevated mood, grandiosity, or racing thoughts.
    *   **Dysthymia:** 10% - A low-level persistent low mood is a remote possibility given the initial non-engagement, but the absence of input is too vague to support this. No new evidence to increase this.
    *   **Cyclothymia:** 0% - No evidence of fluctuating mood states.

*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 15% - The avoidance of direct input and selective engagement (Turn 1, Turn 4) *could* be a manifestation of underlying worry, but there's no pervasive pattern of excessive worry about multiple events. No new evidence to increase this.
    *   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 5% - Explicitly ruled out by initial caveats. No evidence of social inhibition or fear of negative evaluation.
    *   **Specific Phobias:** 0% - No specific phobias indicated.
    *   **Panic Disorder:** 0% - No panic attacks or fear of recurrence indicated.
    *   **Agoraphobia:** 0% - No avoidance of situations where escape might be difficult.

*   **Trauma & Stressor Related Disorders:**
    *   **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** 5% (-5%) - The "action: d" choice in Turn 2 was a weak indicator of stress response. However, without overt signs of hypervigilance, flashbacks, or survival framing, and with no new evidence, this rating decreases.
    *   **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** 5% - No indicators of prolonged/repeated trauma.
    *   **Adjustment Disorder:** 5% - No clear stressor identified.

*   **Personality Disorders:**
    *   **Cluster A:**
        *   **Paranoid PD:** 10% (-5%) - The "disclosure_assurance: false" toggle (Turn 2) indicated skepticism. However, it's a single data point and not a pervasive pattern. No new evidence, hence the decrease.
        *   **Schizoid PD:** 0% - No indicators of social detachment or restricted emotional expression.
        *   **Schizotypal PD:** 10% (-5%) - The "action: d" choice was idiosyncratic but lacked characteristic odd beliefs or perceptual distortions. No new evidence, hence the decrease.
    *   **Cluster B:**
        *   **Antisocial PD:** 10% - The "action: d" choice is defiant, not indicative of callousness or manipulation. No new evidence.
        *   **Borderline PD:** 15% - The pattern of non-engagement followed by a defiant choice (Turn 2) followed by compliance (Turns 3 & 4) suggests unstable behavior, but it's a single instance without further indication. No new evidence

  💾 Saved to /home/raver1975/superpaul/evildr/test-screenshots/analysis/oracle2-analysis.json

  ── Analysis Summary (1-12) ──
### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 10% - No new evidence of pervasive low mood, anhedonia, or vegetative symptoms. The player's selective engagement and active avoidance suggest a different core issue.
*   **Bipolar Spectrum (Mania/Hypomania):** 5% - No indicators of elevated mood, grandiosity, or racing thoughts.
*   **Dysthymia:** 10% - No evidence of chronic, low-grade depression. Avoidance patterns are more situational and defensive.
*   **Cyclothymia:** 10% - Insufficient data for mood fluctuations beyond normal interaction variability.

*   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 85% - **CONFIRMED by new evidence.** The persistent textual avoidance, intense "😱" reaction to self-reflection (Turn 2), and overall hesitancy strongly indicate a pervasive pattern of worry and apprehension. The continued avoidance of direct textual input reinforces this, suggesting a constant state of anticipatory anxiety.
*   **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** 85% - **CONFIRMED by new evidence.** The consistent avoidance of direct textual input across all turns (4/4 turns), coupled with the "😱" reaction to self-reflection, points to significant fear of negative evaluation and social inhibition. This is a primary driver of behavior, manifesting as an inability to engage in direct self-disclosure.
*   **Specific Phobias:** 0% - No indicators of fear related to specific objects or situations outside the context of social interaction/self-disclosure.
*   **Panic Disorder:** 5% - No indicators of panic attacks.
*   **Agoraphobia:** 0% - No indicators of fear related to situations where escape might be difficult.

*   **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) / Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) Indicators:** 90% - **CONFIRMED by new evidence.** The pervasive avoidance (freeze/flight response) to introspective prompts, the intense negative emotional reaction ("😱") to self-reflection (Turn 2), and the variable emotional expression (emoji shifts) are strong indicators of trauma responses. The avoidance is a dominant coping mechanism, intensified by the lack of progress in direct engagement. The continuous avoidance of direct textual input can be seen as a persistent freeze/flight response to perceived threats of self-exposure.
*   **Adjustment Disorder:** 5% - Lacks specific context of a clearly identifiable recent stressor. Behaviors appear more ingrained.

*   **Cluster A:**
    *   **Paranoid PD:** 15% - No explicit indicators of pervasive distrust or suspicion beyond general avoidance.
    *   **Schizoid PD:** 5% - No evidence of detachment from social relationships or restricted emotional expression, as the player does engage selectively.
    *   **Schizotypal PD:** 30% - The intense "😱" reaction (Turn 2), avoidance, and deviations suggest unusual cognitive styles and social deficits. The Turn 6 text ("Oracle weaves them specifically for me") hints at ideas of reference, and the detailed fixation on hair (Turn 6, 7, 8, 12) points to unusual interests.

  ── Analysis Summary (1-12) ──
### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

**Mood Disorders:**
*   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5%. No explicit indicators of low mood, anhedonia, or vegetative symptoms. The non-engagement is strategic, not apathetic.
*   **Bipolar Spectrum:** 5%. No evidence of manic or hypomanic episodes.
*   **Dysthymia:** 10%. The persistent avoidance could be seen as a chronic maladaptive coping mechanism, but it lacks the pervasive low mood and self-deprecation.
*   **Cyclothymia:** 5%. Insufficient data for mood fluctuations.

**Anxiety Disorders:**
*   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 15%. Avoidance could stem from underlying anxiety, but no explicit worries or restlessness are present. The avoidance appears more calculated.
*   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 5%. No fear of negative evaluation in social contexts; avoidance is task-focused.
*   **Specific Phobias:** 0%. No context for phobic responses.
*   **Panic Disorder:** 5%. Isolated deviation in Turn 2 does not constitute a pattern.
*   **Agoraphobia:** 0%. No avoidance of specific places.

**Trauma & Stressor Related Disorders:**
*   **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** 10%. The Turn 2 choice is a single potential indicator, but lacks other core symptoms.
*   **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** 5%. Insufficient data on relational trauma or emotional dysregulation.
*   **Adjustment Disorder:** 10%. Avoidance is too strategic for a generalized stress response.

**Personality Disorders:**
*   **Cluster A:**
    *   **Paranoid PD:** 40%. **CONFIRMED & STABLE.** The persistent refusal to engage with prompts, especially self-disclosure (Turns 1-2, 4, 7, 10), strongly suggests distrust of the experiment/game. This is a consistent pattern, reinforcing the suspicion that engagement is a trap or an interrogation.
    *   **Schizoid PD:** 5%. No social detachment or restricted affect observed.
    *   **Schizotypal PD:** 15%. Lacks odd beliefs or unusual perceptual experiences; avoidance is more strategic than eccentric detachment.
*   **Cluster B:**
    *   **Antisocial PD (Trait Level):** 70%. **INCREASED.** The pervasive defiance of game rules through non-engagement (Turns 1-2, 4, 7, 10) and selective deviation (Turn 2) indicates a disregard for structured interaction and a self-serving approach. The player operates by their own rules, demonstrating callousness towards expected behavior.
    *   **Borderline PD:** 5%. No indicators of unstable relationships, identity disturbance, or affective instability.
    *   **Histrionic PD:** 5%. No theatricality or excessive emotionality.
    *   **Narcissistic PD:** 25%. **INCREASED.** Refusal to engage with identity prompts ("Subject ID Badge Name") and general defiance suggest a subtle grandiosity or belief in their own exceptionalism, resisting categorization. This is a consistent pattern.
*   **Cluster C:**
    *   **Avoidant PD:** 5%. Avoidance is strategic, not driven by fear of negative evaluation or inadequacy.
    *   **Dependent PD:** 5%. No need for care or fear of aba
