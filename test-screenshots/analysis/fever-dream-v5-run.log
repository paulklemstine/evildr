  Records: 4
  Latest turn range: 1-12
  Text length: 28415 chars

  --- Full Analysis Text ---
This player presents a complex and deeply introspective psychological landscape, characterized by profound detachment, existential dread, and a potent drive to experience reality through overwhelming sensory input and self-abnegation. Their consistent deviations from predicted actions are not random errors, but rather a deliberate assertion of their internal state against external structure, revealing a profound need for agency within a perceived lack of control.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 65% likelihood. The textual declarations "Nothing feels real enough to be dangerous. Or real enough to matter. I'm a ghost haunting my own life" (Turn 4) are textbook manifestations of anhedonia, profound detachment, and existential despair. The extended response times and textual deviations in later turns (Turns 4, 6, 8, 9) suggest withdrawal, significant lack of motivation, and a pervasive absence of feeling.
    *   **Bipolar Spectrum:** 5% likelihood. There are no indicators of elevated mood, grandiosity, racing thoughts, or significant impulsivity characteristic of manic or hypomanic episodes. The intensity of their responses is internally focused and melancholic, not expansively energetic.
    *   **Dysthymia:** 55% likelihood. The persistent theme of unreality, meaninglessness, and the "ghost" metaphor points to a chronic, low-grade depressive state. This isn't about acute episodes but a continuous existential flatness that colors their perception of reality. The constant feeling of living behind a "thin film" (Turn 9) suggests a long-standing state of disconnection.
    *   **Cyclothymia:** 5% likelihood. No evidence of rapid, distinct mood swings. The observed fluctuations are in engagement patterns and the intensity of expressed distress, not overt shifts in mood state.

*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 30% likelihood. While the pervasive unreality leans more towards dissociative phenomena, the underlying sense of unease, detachment, and withdrawal can certainly be a manifestation of chronic, underlying anxiety. The overwhelm suggested by the extended response times in later turns could be an anxiety-driven shutdown.
    *   **Social Anxiety:** 5% likelihood. No direct evidence of fear or avoidance of social situations. Their introspection is deep and internal, not driven by fear of social evaluation.
    *   **Specific Phobias:** 0% likelihood. No specific fears identified in the interaction data.
    *   **Panic Disorder:** 5% likelihood. No reports or indicators of panic attacks.
    *   **Agoraphobia:** 5% likelihood. The avoidance observed is internal and existential, not related to external places or crowds.

*   **Trauma & Stressor Related Disorders:**
    *   **PTSD/Complex PTSD:** 60% likelihood. The "ghost haunting my own life" is a potent dissociative marker, often seen in trauma responses. The intense desire to "consume this experience. L
