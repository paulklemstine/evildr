  ── Analysis Summary (1-12) ──
Let's dive into this. The player has certainly provided a rich tapestry of responses, moving from silence to a complex interplay of trauma-driven behavior and deliberate coping mechanisms. My analysis will focus on the raw data, synthesizing it into a cohesive psychological profile.

## 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - While the dissociative state could mimic anhedonia, it's more directly attributable to trauma response rather than a pervasive low mood. The lack of other depressive indicators supports this decrease.
    *   **Bipolar Spectrum:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No evidence of manic or hypomanic episodes. Choice deviations are better explained by trauma and anxiety.
    *   **Dysthymia:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - Similar to MDD, the dissociative response is the primary driver, not chronic low mood.
    *   **Cyclothymia:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - No evidence of alternating mood states.

*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   **GAD:** 15% (Decreased from 25%) - The mention of therapy and grounding techniques indicates active management of anxiety. However, the "zoned out" state is more directly attributable to trauma. Pervasive worry across multiple contexts is not evident.
    *   **Social Anxiety:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - Turn 1 non-response is unreliable. Subsequent engagement and choice deviations do not point to a fear of negative evaluation in social settings.
    *   **Specific Phobias:** 5% (No change) - No specific phobias indicated.
    *   **Panic Disorder:** 10% (Decreased from 15%) - The "screaming" reference could be a trigger, but there's no pattern of recurrent, unexpected panic attacks presented.
    *   **Agoraphobia:** 5% (No change) - No indicators.

*   **Trauma & Stressor:**
    *   **PTSD:** 95% (Increased from 75%) - **HIGH CONFIDENCE.** The Turn 3 text response ("Sorry. I zoned out. I was somewhere else. Somewhere loud. With screaming. It happens. My therapist says to ground myself. Five things I can see...") is a direct report of dissociation, a potential flashback trigger, and a learned coping mechanism. The consistent avoidance of predicted "bold" actions in favor of more evasive/passive choices (Turns 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12) strongly supports avoidance of overwhelming stimuli and direct confrontation, consistent with PTSD. The compulsive checking behavior in Turn 8 ("I check behind me every 30 seconds. Force of habit. The last time I didn't check, I woke up in a hospital.") is a clear indicator of hypervigilance.
    *   **Complex PTSD:** 50% (Increased from 40%) - The core PTSD indicators are robust, and the compulsive checking behavior points to a pervasive pattern of hypervigilance and safety behaviors often seen in C-PTSD. The data is still limited for establishing the chronic, interpersonal trauma characteristic of C-PTSD, but the evidence is strengthening.
    *   **Adjustment Disorder:** 5% (Decreased from 10%) - The intensi
