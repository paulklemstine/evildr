  ── Alice Analysis (1-12) ──
This is an intriguing case, marked by a profound initial withdrawal followed by a series of deliberate, analytical engagements. The player’s interaction style is characterized by a keen observational focus and a strategic approach to connection, rather than spontaneous emotional reciprocity. Let's dissect the data to construct a comprehensive psychological profile.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Voyeurism:** 70% Likelihood.
    *   **Evidence:** Turn 2's specific observation of "fingers linger on the plaque, like he's trying to absorb every bit of information" highlights a passive, detail-oriented observation. The choice of "Intrigued" coupled with a low connection rating (3) suggests an analytical interest over immediate emotional engagement. Most critically, Turn 9's textual input ("Do you ever wonder who's watching you? I watch people all the time. From my window. The couple across the street doesn't close their blinds.") directly introduces themes of surveillance and passive observation of others' lives. The choice of "Clever probe into his internal state" in Turn 9 further aligns with observing and analyzing another's reactions.
    *   **Contradicting Evidence:** No explicit "watching" or "peeping" language is present across all text inputs. The interest is framed around information absorption, which is a broader category.
*   **Autism Spectrum Indicators (Subthreshold):** 70% Likelihood.
    *   **Evidence:** Turn 1's complete non-response across multiple prompts demonstrates a significant difficulty with social reciprocity and processing social cues. The focus on "absorb every bit of information" (Turn 2) over social nuance, and the consistent analytical/probing approach in subsequent turns, suggest a preference for structured, logical interaction over spontaneous emotional connection. The Turn 9 text about watching people from a window, while potentially voyeuristic, can also indicate a detached, observational stance typical of social challenges.
    *   **

  ── Bob Analysis (1-12) ──
This player's interaction is characterized by a profound and consistent avoidance of active participation, particularly in free-text fields. The initial instantaneous response in Turn 1 stands in stark contrast to the subsequent pervasive silence and selective engagement with pre-defined choices. This pattern suggests a significant internal conflict, likely driven by anxiety or a deeply ingrained avoidance behavior.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 10% - While anhedonia could manifest as lack of engagement, there's no direct evidence of sustained low mood, vegetative symptoms, or loss of interest beyond the interactive context. The avoidance appears more driven by apprehension than by a pervasive lack of pleasure.
    *   **Bipolar spectrum:** 2% - No manic or hypomanic symptoms are present.
    *   **Dysthymia:** 10% - A chronic low-grade depression could explain the lack of engagement, but the pattern is more indicative of situational anxiety or personality-driven avoidance.
    *   **Cyclothymia:** 2% - No evidence of mood cycling.
*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 30% - The inability to commit to responses, especially free-text, suggests apprehension about making the "wrong" choice or saying something inappropriate, pointing to generalized worry about performance. This is moderately supported by the slow response times and avoidance of open-ended prompts.
    *   **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** 25% - **(Decreased from 30%)** The pervasive avoidance across all interaction types, not just conversational, leans more towards a personality disorder trait. The INSTANT response in Turn 1 also detracts from a pure SAD diagnosis, suggesting the avoidance is not solely tied to social evaluation in real-time conversation.
    *   **Specific Phobias:** 0% - No specific phobias indicated.
    *   **Panic Disorder:** 5% - No panic attacks or anticipatory anxiety about panic are
