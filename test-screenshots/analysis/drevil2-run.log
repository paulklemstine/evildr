     💬 "Well, well, well. Another one. Welcome to my lab. Don't worry — the door locks automatically. Standard procedure. Now then... let's see what you're made of."
     💬 "The corridor stretches ahead — five doors, each a different color, each humming at a different frequency. Something moves behind the glass wall to your left."
     💬 "Ohhh, this is going to be FUN. I can already tell."
     💬 "A buzzer sounds. The five doors start to CLOSE — one by one. You have seconds."
     💬 "Oh, you think THAT was the experiment? That was the WARMUP."

  📖 Dr. Evil sees:
     💬 "Ah, the Echo Chamber! One of my personal favorites. You see, this room doesn't just make noise, it interprets it. And right now, it's interpreting your… enthusiasm for that pedestal. The hum you heard..."
     💬 "The central pedestal pulses with a sickly green light. Auditory feedback has escalated from a hum to a disorienting, high-frequency whine that seems to vibrate from the very walls. A console beside it..."

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5% - No new evidence of persistent low mood, anhedonia, or vegetative symptoms. Initial lack of input is better explained by other factors.
*   **Bipolar Spectrum:** 5% - No change. No manic or hypomanic episodes indicated.
*   **Dysthymia:** 5% - No new evidence of sustained low mood.
*   **Cyclothymia:** 5% - No change. No fluctuating mood states indicated.
*   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 10% - Initial hesitation (Turn 1) not sustained or linked to specific triggers. Later turns show active, albeit avoidant, engagement.
*   **Social Anxiety:** 10% - Lack of input for "Subject ID Badge Name" (Turn 1) does not constitute pervasive social inhibition or fear of judgment in multiple contexts, especially within a game.
*   **Specific Phobias:** 5% - No specific phobias indicated.
*   **Panic Disorder:** 5% - No panic attacks or fear of them indicated.
*   **Agoraphobia:** 5% - No avoidance of situations where escape might be difficult.
*   **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** 10% - Initial hesitation (Turn 1) could be a "freeze" response, but subsequent actions (avoidance, deviation) suggest deliberate strategy rather than trauma re-experiencing. No flashback or hypervigilance cues.
*   **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** 10% - Lacks pervasive interpersonal difficulties and negative self-concept.
*   **Adjustment Disorder:** 10% - No clear stressor and subsequent maladaptive reaction.
*   **Paranoid PD:** 5% - No evidence of pervasive distrust or suspicion. Avoidance is strategic, not fear-based.
*   **Schizoid PD:** 5% - No evidence of detachment or restricted emotional expression.
*   **Schizotypal PD:** 10% - Avoidance behaviors are more indicative of passive resistance or strategic play than odd beliefs or eccentricities.
*   **Antisocial PD (ASPD):** 45% (**INCREASED from 25%**) - **NEW EVIDENCE:** Consistent deviations from predicted choices (Turn 2, Turn 3, Turn 5, Turn 6) demonstrate a disregard for expected gameplay, aligning with a pattern of rule-breaking. Disabling speakers (Turns 3, 4) suggests calculated disregard for intended mechanics. These actions show a disregard for the system's design and intent.
*   **Borderline PD:** 10% - No evidence of unstable relationships, self-image, affect, or impulsivity across multiple domains.
*   **Histrionic PD:** 5% - No theatricality or attention-seeking; avoidance is the opposite.
*   **Narcissistic PD:** 10% - No evidence of grandiosity or need for admiration.
*   **Avoidant PD:** 5% - Avoidance is not pervasive across multiple *social* contexts and lacks self-deprecation. It appears strategic.
*   **Dependent PD:** 5% - No evidence of excessive need to be taken care of.
