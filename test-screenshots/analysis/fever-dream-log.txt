  💾 Saved to /home/raver1975/superpaul/evildr/test-screenshots/analysis/fever-dream-analysis.json

  ── Analysis Summary (1-8) ──
Alright, let's dissect this "fever-dream." The player's engagement is certainly leaning into the surreal, and the text responses are a goldmine of psychological data. This isn't just a game; it's a window.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Dissociative Disorders: Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (DPDR): 98%**
    *   **Evidence:** The player's explicit and repeated statements are the bedrock of this assessment. Turn 3: "I can see my body doing things but I'm not connected to it. Like a puppet show where someone forgot to tell me I'm the puppet." This is a textbook description of depersonalization. Turn 5: "The walls are breathing again but I know they're not because walls don't breathe because walls aren't real because NOTHING is real." This powerfully conveys derealization. The repetition of these themes in Turns 6 and 8 ("I can see my body doing things but I'm not connected to it. Like a puppet show where someone forgot to tell me I'm the puppet.") solidifies this as a pervasive experience within the game.
    *   **Delta:** Increased from 95% to 98%. The sheer repetition of the depersonalization statement and the consistent derealization theme underscore the severity and pervasiveness of these dissociative experiences.

*   **Trauma & Stressor: Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) indicators: 55%**
    *   **Evidence:** Depersonalization and derealization are strongly correlated with complex trauma. The "puppet" analogy (Turn 3, 6, 8) suggests a history of feeling controlled or lacking agency, a hallmark of prolonged trauma. The Turn 4 and 7 statements ("I've done things that should have killed me. Car surfing. Free climbing. Standing in traffic. Each time the world snaps back into focus. Brilliant, terrible focus.") are highly indicative of trauma-related coping mechanisms. Engaging in extreme risk-taking behavior, followed by a dissociative "snap back into focus," points to a pattern of emotional dysregulation and a paradoxical relationship with danger, often seen in C-PTSD.
    *   **Delta:** Increased from 40% to 55%. The consistent detailing of high-risk behaviors and the "snap back into focus" phenomenon in Turns 4 and 7, coupled with the depersonalization/derealization, provides a more robust picture of C-PTSD symptoms beyond just dissociation.

*   **Mood Disorders: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Dissociative Features: 40%**
    *   **Evidence:** The themes of disconnection, lack of agency ("puppet"), and nihilism ("NOTHING is real") strongly suggest a depressive overlay. The risky behaviors (Turns 4, 7) could be interpreted as a form of self-harm or an attempt to escape profound anhedonia or emotional numbness. The feeling of being a "puppet" can also align with profound hopelessness.
    *   **Delta:** Increased from 30% to 40%. The repeated expression of detachment and nihilism, now linked to specific high-risk behaviors, strengthens the possibility of MDD with dissociative features.

*   **Personality Disorders: Cluster A - Schizotypal
