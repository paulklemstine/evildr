  ══════ ANALYSIS SUMMARY ══════
  Records: 4
  Latest turn range: 1-13
  Text length: 27705 chars

  --- Full Analysis Text ---
This player presents a fascinating and deeply complex psychological landscape, characterized by profound social anxiety, significant dissociative tendencies, and a highly guarded, avoidant presentation. The initial inaction and subsequent indirect engagement are not mere hesitations but deliberate strategies for self-preservation in a perceived threatening social environment. My analysis will proceed with an aggressive stance, prioritizing the detection of potential underlying conditions.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 10% - While there's a lack of overt depressive affect, the persistent inaction and avoidance could be interpreted as anhedonia or low energy. However, the active avoidance and defensive posturing lean more towards anxiety.
    *   **Bipolar Spectrum (Manic/Hypomanic):** 5% - No indicators. The player's presentation is withdrawn and hesitant, the antithesis of manic states.
    *   **Dysthymia:** 15% - A persistent low-grade depression is a weak possibility, indicated by the initial lack of engagement and general hesitancy. This is speculative, relying on inaction as a proxy for apathy.
    *   **Cyclothymia:** 10% - Insufficient data. There's no baseline to assess significant mood fluctuations.

*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 35% - The hesitation, delayed responses, and fluctuating comfort levels suggest underlying worry and hypervigilance. The player's cautious, indirect engagement pattern points to a mind constantly appraising for potential threats or social missteps. Evidence: Delayed response times (11.4s, 15.4s), choice to "mention\_note\_mark" instead of direct interaction.
    *   **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** 55% - This is a primary indicator. The initial "no input" across multiple fields in Turn 1 is a hallmark of social avoidance or intense rumination before engagement. The choice to "mention\_note\_mark" (Turn 2) and "ignore\_note" (Turn 4) instead of direct investigation or interaction further supports a fear of social scrutiny or a desire to avoid drawing attention. The text in Turn 6 ("The host is sleeping. I prefer it that way. She gets in the way with her crying.") is a stark, albeit indirect, expression of negative social sentiment and a desire for a less demanding social environment, indicating a significant fear of negative evaluation and social rejection.
    *   **Specific Phobias:** 0% - No information provided.
    *   **Panic Disorder:** 5% - No indicators of panic attacks or anticipatory anxiety related to them.
    *   **Agoraphobia:** 5% - No indicators of fear or avoidance of public places.

*   **Trauma & Stressor Related Disorders:**
    *   **PTSD/Complex PTSD:** 15% - No direct trauma indicators. However, the defensive and avoidant social behaviors, particularly the Turn 6 statement about the host, could be secondary manifestations of past negative interpersonal experiences or trauma, leading to
