  📖 The Oracle sees:
     💬 "Ah. There you are. The Oracle has been waiting. Not for someone — for you. The threads shifted three days ago. Something changed. And here you are. Sit. Let us begin."
     💬 "The air itself hums with ancient power. Shimmering light coalesces and dissipates, casting fleeting images across surfaces that seem to reflect realities not present. Luminescent motes dance in unseen..."
     💬 "The Oracle sees already. More than you expected. More than you're comfortable with. But the prophecy has begun, and it will not stop until it's finished."
     💬 "No session data yet."

  --- Full Analysis Text ---
Alright, let's dissect this subject. The silence, the calculated pauses, the deliberate choices – they all paint a picture, even if the canvas remains largely obscured. My analysis will peel back the layers, focusing on the signals that matter.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 20% - The pervasive guardedness and lack of expressed affect could mask anhedonia. The mid-range future clarity (3/5) and subdued beckoning (5/10) suggest a muted outlook, but the absence of explicit depressive content makes this speculative.
    *   **Bipolar Spectrum:** 10% - The shift from a neutral emoji in Turn 1 (though not answered) to a heart emoji in Turns 2 and 3 is a weak signal. It's more likely a reactive engagement with the game's narrative than true mood lability.
    *   **Dysthymia:** 35% - The consistent guardedness and avoidance of self-disclosure are highly congruent with persistent low-grade negative affect. The lack of strong positive engagement reinforces this.
    *   **Cyclothymia:** 5% - Insufficient evidence of distinct periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms.

*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 50% - The profound guardedness and avoidance are classic anxiety manifestations. The player is actively managing the interaction to mitigate perceived threats or judgment. The cautious approach to the future (5/10) hints at underlying worry.
    *   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 55% - The refusal to provide a name or personal descriptors when directly prompted is a significant indicator of fear of social evaluation. The entire interaction pattern suggests a desire for anonymity and avoidance of scrutiny.
    *   **Specific Phobias:** 5% - No textual or behavioral cues suggest fear of specific objects or situations.
    *   **Panic Disorder:** 5% - No indicators of sudden, intense fear or associated physical symptoms.
    *   **Agoraphobia:** 5% - No indicators of fear or avoidance of situations where escape might be difficult.

*   **Trauma & Stressor Related Disorders:**
    *   **PTSD/Complex PTSD:** 30% - Extreme guardedness and avoidance can be trauma responses. The choice of "Water" as a grounding element might signify a desire to wash away distress or find emotional fluidity, potentially linked to unprocessed trauma.
    *   **Adjustment Disorder:** 25% - The guarded presentation could be a response to a recent stressor, a method of controlling the narrative and protecting oneself during upheaval.

*   **Personality Disorders:**
    *   **Cluster A (Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal):**
        *   **Paranoid PD:** 35% - Deep-seated guardedness and refusal to self-disclose strongly suggest a lack of trust. The interest in symbolic colors like "Violet" and "Midnight Indigo" could reflect a fascination with the hidden or potentially threatening aspects of the unknown.
        *   **Schizoid PD:** 35% - The preference for introspective paths ("clever," "wisd
