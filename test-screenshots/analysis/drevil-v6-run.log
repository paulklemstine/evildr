  --- Full Analysis Text ---
This subject presents a deeply concerning and rapidly evolving psychological profile. The initial non-response in Turn 1, which I initially interpreted as strategic avoidance or suspicion, now appears to be a precursor to a profound break from reality. The explicit statements in Turn 5 are the critical data points, shifting the entire diagnostic focus.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   Major Depressive Disorder: 5% (Previously 10%). No sustained low mood, anhedonia, or vegetative symptoms. Engagement, albeit fractured, suggests some baseline functioning.
    *   Bipolar Spectrum: 5% (Previously 5%). No clear manic or hypomanic symptoms.
    *   Dysthymia: 10% (Previously 15%). Minimal engagement could hint at low-grade depression, but this is overshadowed by more acute indicators.
    *   Cyclothymia: 5% (Previously 10%). Lacks evidence of distinct mood swings.

*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): 35% (Previously 30%). Slow deliberation in early turns (2, 4) and selective engagement suggest rumination. The "😱" reaction in Turn 2, now contextualized by Turn 5, points to significant distress.
    *   Social Anxiety: 10% (Previously 15%). Avoidance of text fields is more indicative of task aversion or executive dysfunction than social inhibition. Lacks pervasive fear of judgment or self-deprecation.
    *   Specific Phobias: 0% (Previously 5%). No specific phobias indicated.
    *   Panic Disorder: 0% (Previously 5%). No panic attack symptoms.
    *   Agoraphobia: 0% (Previously 0%). No relevant data.

    *   PTSD: 5% (Previously 10%). No direct indicators linked to past trauma.
    *   Complex PTSD (C-PTSD): 10% (Previously 15%). Weak signals; the current presentation suggests more acute psychotic decompensation.
