  --- Full Analysis Text ---
This player presents a complex and deeply guarded profile, characterized by a strategic avoidance of direct engagement, particularly in textual communication. Their interaction is a masterclass in control, where actions speak louder than words, and silence is a weapon. The consistent pattern of withholding information, coupled with specific, albeit minimal, action choices and response time anomalies, paints a picture of someone deeply invested in managing their exposure, perceived threat, and emotional regulation.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING ###

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5% - The player's engagement, albeit strategic and avoidant, suggests an active engagement with the environment and a capacity for tactical decision-making, which is inconsistent with the pervasive anhedonia and low mood characteristic of MDD.
    *   **Bipolar Spectrum:** 5% - No indicators of elevated mood, grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, or significant shifts in energy levels are present. Their decision-making appears tactical and deliberate, not manic or hypomanic.
    *   **Dysthymia:** 5% - The player is actively making choices and adapting to scenarios, indicating a level of engagement beyond the chronic low-grade depression associated with dysthymia. Their avoidance is a strategic defense, not a symptom of pervasive low mood.
    *   **Cyclothymia:** 5% - No evidence of fluctuating mood states or energy levels is observed. Their behavioral shifts appear to be responses to external stimuli and strategic calculations, not internal mood instability.

*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 70% - **Very high indicators.** The pervasive avoidance of direct textual input, particularly on questions requiring personal disclosure or creative output, is a hallmark of generalized worry about negative evaluation, exposure, or judgment. The inconsistent response times (0ms in Turn 1 vs. 12893ms in Turn 2) suggest significant internal conflict, rumination, and difficulty with task initiation or sustained engagement under pressure. The high sprint setting (8) in Turn 1 and the choice of aggressive action ('a') in Turn 3, despite predicted caution, point to a heightened state of arousal and a reactive coping mechanism under perceived threat.
    *   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 40% - Moderate indicators. The avoidance of text fields can be interpreted as a fear of social judgment or scrutiny, even in a simulated environment. However, this is heavily intertwined with general cautiousness, a desire for control, and potential paranoia, making it difficult to isolate pure social anxiety.
    *   **Specific Phobias:** 5% - No specific phobic object or situation has been presented or avoided. Their avoidance is generalized to communication and disclosure.
    *   **Panic Disorder:** 10% - Low indicators. While there are moments of high urgency (sprint slider, aggressive actions), there's no evidence of recurrent, unexp
