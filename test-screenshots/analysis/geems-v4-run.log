  Records: 2
  Latest turn range: 1-6
  Text length: 22822 chars

  --- Full Analysis Text ---
Alright, let's dive into geems' psyche. This isn't about playing nice; it's about seeing what's *there*. The lack of direct text input is a wall, but the choices, the timings, the *omissions*—they're screaming. Let's break down what's happening.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING ###

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 10% - No indicators of persistent low mood, anhedonia, or significant vegetative symptoms. Player engagement is active within the game.
    *   **Bipolar Spectrum (Mania/Hypomania):** 5% - No indicators of elevated mood, grandiosity, racing thoughts, or excessive energy beyond game-driven urgency.
    *   **Dysthymia:** 20% - The lack of verbal output and reliance on mechanical choices could suggest a subdued internal state or a form of avoidance, but this is highly speculative without more direct emotional expression. It's not a strong indicator of chronic low mood, but rather a lack of expressed affect.
    *   **Cyclothymia:** 10% - No observable mood fluctuations.

*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 35% - The player exhibits a pervasive pattern of preemptive risk assessment and mitigation. Actions like "trust\_bridge" (true), "distract\_guardians" (true), "listen\_for\_creatures" (true), and consistent high speed sliders (8, 8, 7) point to an underlying vigilance and a need to control perceived threats. This suggests a baseline level of worry that drives proactive, sometimes aggressive, behaviors.
    *   **Social Anxiety:** 5% - The absence of text input is more likely a strategic choice within the game interface or a preference for action over dialogue, rather than discomfort with social interaction in a digital space.
    *   **Specific Phobias:** 0% - No specific fears are indicated.
    *   **Panic Disorder:** 15% - The high speed selections (8, 8, 7) could be interpreted as an agitated state, but it's more likely a response to game urgency and a drive for stimulation rather than an acute panic attack. The response time anomaly in Turn 2 (8683ms) could indicate a moment of processing under pressure, but not necessarily panic.
    *   **Agoraphobia:** 0% - No indicators present.

*   **Trauma & Stressor-Related Disorders:**
    *   **PTSD/Complex PTSD:** 25% - The player's hypervigilance (constant threat assessment, checking bridge, listening for creatures) and proactive defensive actions ("distract\_guardians") are consistent with hyperarousal and a need to control environment, often seen in trauma survivors. The deviation in Turn 2 could be an unexpected reaction to a perceived threat or stimulus. Without direct trauma narrative, this remains speculative but plausible.
    *   **Adjustment Disorder:** 10% - Insufficient context to assess adaptation to a specific stressor.

*   **Personality Disorders:**
    *   **Cluster A (Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal):**
        *   **Paranoid:** 45% - Strong indicators. The player consistently anticipates threats, verifies saf
