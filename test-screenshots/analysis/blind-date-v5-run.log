  ── Alice Analysis (1-12) ──
This player's interaction profile presents a complex interplay of controlled self-presentation, strategic avoidance, and a deep-seated drive for understanding. Their engagement is highly deliberate, marked by calculated pauses and carefully chosen responses, suggesting a significant degree of self-monitoring and a wariness of spontaneous social interaction. The analysis reveals a strong inclination towards self-protection, a critical assessment of their environment, and a profound interest in dissecting the motivations and flaws of others.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5% - No sustained indicators of pervasive low mood, anhedonia, or significant functional impairment. The active, albeit cautious, engagement points away from MDD.
    *   **Bipolar Spectrum (Mania/Hypomania):** 5% - No indicators of elevated mood, grandiosity, pressured speech, or decreased need for sleep.
    *   **Dysthymia:** 15% - A low-level, chronic dissatisfaction could be inferred from their guardedness and preference for discussing negative aspects, which might suggest a persistent low mood. However, there's insufficient evidence of functional impairment or pervasive depressive symptoms to meet diagnostic criteria.
    *   **Cyclothymia:** 10% - No clear evidence of distinct hypomanic or depressive episodes.

*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 25% - The consistent guardedness, calculated responses, and desire to "know where I stand" hint at underlying anxiety about social interaction and a need for predictability and control. Their deliberate pacing suggests an effort to manage internal unease, but specific GAD symptoms like excessive worry across multiple domains are not yet evident.
    *   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 40% - The response time delays (e.g., 25s, 17s, 25s, 22s), the strategic choice of "guarded" vibes, and the initial "no input" for multiple prompts are significant flags for pote

  ── Bob Analysis (1-12) ──
Alright, let's dissect Bob. The data paints a picture of someone deeply entrenched in avoidance, using a carefully constructed performance to shield themselves. This isn't a simple case of shyness; it's an active, strategic withdrawal.

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

*   **Mood Disorders:**
    *   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 15% - While the lack of engagement can mimic anhedonia, the pattern leans more towards anxiety and social discomfort. There are no core symptoms of persistent low mood, guilt, or significant vegetative changes reported. The avoidance appears driven by fear of evaluation rather than pervasive sadness.
    *   **Bipolar Spectrum (Hypomania/Mania):** 5% - No indicators of elevated mood, grandiosity, racing thoughts, or significant impulsivity beyond the initial rapid response time. The "performance" later on is calculated, not manic.
    *   **Dysthymia:** 30% - A chronic low-grade melancholic outlook could contribute to a general lack of enthusiasm and motivation for personal disclosure. This would explain a baseline disengagement, but doesn't fully account for the specific, performative avoidance observed.
    *   **Cyclothymia:** 10% - No evidence of marked mood swings or rapid cycling between hypomanic and depressive states.
*   **Anxiety Disorders:**
    *   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 35% - The pervasive worry about social evaluation, fear of judgment ("She's probably judging my wipe obsession"), and tendency to withdraw when faced with perceived social risk are consistent with GAD. However, the pattern is more specifically tied to social interaction than diffuse worry.
    *   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** **75%** - This is a primary driver. The consistent refusal to engage with free-text fields, the avoidance of direct personal questions, and the performative actions in later turns are hallmark signs of intense fear of negative evaluation, embarrassment, or scrutiny in social interactions. The 0ms response time in Turn 1, followed b
