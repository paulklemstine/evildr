     💬 "You left the silver to its own devices. A wise choice. It has learned your intent, and now it shapes itself. Not into what you desired, but into what the dream desires for you. And it is magnificent."
     💬 "The air here hums with a low, resonant frequency, like the echo of a thousand distant bells. Each breath you take is cool and tastes faintly of ozone and forgotten secrets. The light isn't just seen; ..."
