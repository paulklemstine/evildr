## Psychological Profile

### 1. DSM-5 SCREENING

**Mood Disorders:**
*   **Major Depressive Disorder:** 5% - No persistent low mood, anhedonia, or vegetative symptoms. Player engagement, though unconventional, is active and goal-directed. (Prior: 5%) - **NO CHANGE.**
*   **Bipolar Spectrum:** 10% - No clear manic or hypomanic episodes. Rapid, strategic responses are not indicative of elevated mood or grandiosity. (Prior: 10%) - **NO CHANGE.**
*   **Dysthymia:** 5% - No indicators of chronic, low-grade depression. (Prior: 5%) - **NO CHANGE.**
*   **Cyclothymia:** 10% - Fluctuations in response style lack the characteristic intensity and duration of cyclothymic mood swings. (Prior: 10%) - **NO CHANGE.**

**Anxiety Disorders:**
*   **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** 30% - Heightened vigilance, suspicion, and a proactive testing strategy suggest a state of heightened alert. Focus on subtle cues of "wrongness" and intense conviction ("screams at me") point to underlying anxiety. (Prior: 30%) - **NO CHANGE.**
*   **Social Anxiety Disorder:** 10% - Initial non-responsiveness on some prompts is not indicative of pervasive fear of negative evaluation. Subsequent detailed textual responses show willingness to engage on player's terms. (Prior: 15%) - **DECREASED** due to lack of new evidence supporting social inhibition or fear of judgment.
*   **Specific Phobias:** 5% - No specific phobic object or situation identified. (Prior: 5%) - **NO CHANGE.**
*   **Panic Disorder:** 5% - No indicators of recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. (Prior: 5%) - **NO CHANGE.**
*   **Agoraphobia:** 5% - No fear or avoidance of situations where escape might be difficult. (Prior: 5%) - **NO CHANGE.**

**Trauma & Stressor Related Disorders:**
*   **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** 75% - Player exhibits intense focus on authenticity, perceived "wrongness," and hypervigilance ("The way they hold their hands is wrong. A fraction off."). Strategy of testing for deception ("ask a question only the REAL person would know") is a coping mechanism. Turn 4 text ("I've been told I stand in doorways at night. Watching. I don't always remember doing it. But there's something sacred about unconsciousness.") directly hints at dissociative or trauma-related memory gaps and surveillance behavior. (Prior: 55%) - **INCREASED** due to the consistent, intense focus on detecting deception and the specific, detailed observations as evidence of "wrongness," aligning with hypervigilance and threat detection. Turn 4's explicit mention of memory gaps and surveillance behavior strongly supports this.
*   **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** 65% - Persistent distrust, focus on authenticity, and sophisticated detection strategy align with C-PTSD, potentially stemming from relational trauma. (Prior: 45%) - **INCREASED** due to the sustained pattern of distrust and the development of a complex, rule-based strategy for navigating perceived threats.
*   **Adjustment Disorder:** 5% - Behavior appears internal
